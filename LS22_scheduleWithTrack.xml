    <EventDescription>Prion proteins are commonly associated with fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals, but are also responsible for a number of harmless heritable phenotypes in \textit{S. cerevisiae} (yeast). In normal conditions, yeast colonies grow in circular shapes, displaying a uniform white or pink color (prion phenotype) related to the fraction of normal (non-prion) protein. While in mammals prion phenotypes are irreversible, in yeast mild experimental manipulations destabilize prion phenotypes, introduce changes in the intracellular prion aggregation dynamics, and cause colonies to exhibit sectors showing both prion (white or pink) and non-prion (red) phenotypes. The precise mechanism of this destabilization and forces influencing the emergence of mixed colony phenotypes are unknown. As such, experimental colonies provide a rich dataset to uncover relationships between colony-level phenotypic transitions, molecular processes, and individual cell behaviors.  Here, I present ongoing work on an automated deep-learning pipeline to extract detailed information about sector-like structure formations in images of yeast colonies.  The pipeline uses a convolutional neural network and the circle Hough transform to quantify the shape, size, and frequency of sectors in experimental data.  This approach will streamline quantification and annotation of yeast colonies grown under experimental conditions and offer additional insights into mechanisms driving colony-level phenotypic transitions.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The oral route is used most frequently for drug administration in human due to its safety, reduced cost, and high degree of patient compliance, but it is also the most complex way for an active pharmaceutical ingredient to enter the body. This complexity is because drug absorption via the gastrointestinal tract depends not only on factors related to the drug and its formulation, but also the contents and motility of the stomach. Also, the dynamic physiological environment of the stomach generates complex pill trajectories and non-uniform rate of dissolution and emptying of the drug into the duodenum, which potentially affects drug bioavailability. These issues pose several challenges to the design of drug delivery systems from R&amp;D, clinical, and regulatory perspectives. These are particularly relevant for disease conditions that are associated with alterations in the anatomy and/or physiology of the stomach as current clinical approaches to assess the efficacy of oral drugs are limited in their ability to elucidate the relationship between bioavailability and altered stomach. We employ “StomachSim”, a CFD model of human stomach, to investigate the effect of body posture and stomach motility on drug bioavailability and understand the fluid-dynamic mechanisms of drug dissolution.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Celiac disease is a hereditary autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1 in 133 Americans. It is caused by a reaction to the protein gluten found in wheat, rye, and barley. After ingesting gluten, a patient with celiac disease may experience a range of unpleasant symptoms while small intestinal villi, essential to nutrient absorption, are destroyed in an immune-mediated process. The only known treatment for this disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet and there is currently no drug treatment. This work provides a mathematical model to better understand the effects of immune activation on gut health using a system of ordinary differential equations to track changes in small intestinal cell densities and relates them to the Q-MARSH score, a criterion used in the diagnosis of celiac disease. The model can be used to investigate and analyze the immune response and various theories behind the progression of this disease by focusing on understanding the dynamics of the small intestine in situations mirroring healthy function and celiac disease. By doing so, we can assist in further quantifying and augmenting diagnostic measures and investigate potential therapies to mitigate the negative effects of celiac disease.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases and remains a significant global health burden even in the face of COVID.  TB disease and pathology presents clinically across a spectrum of outcomes, ranging from total sterilization of infection to active disease.  Much remains unknown about the immunobiology that drives an individual towards various clinical outcomes as it is challenging to experimentally address specific mechanisms driving outcomes. Furthermore, it is unknown whether numbers of immune cells in the blood accurately reflect ongoing events during infection within human lungs.  We have utilized a myriad of multi-scale approaches and analyses to study the host immune response to Mtb across multiple physiologic and time scales.  The models we developed range from molecular scale to whole-host scale and we used a hybrid approach combining differential equations and agent-based modeling at multiple scales. We use extensive analyses to predict mechanisms in the system driving different outcomes via parameters. Additionally, a key goal is to improve antibiotic treatment for TB. Currently multiple drugs are used simultaneously over a 6-9 month period which is a burden on the patient and medical system.  We use our models to predict regimens that can improve clinical treatment of TB.

    <EventDescription>A central challenge for animals when alone, or when grouping with others, is deciding where to go. Running, swimming, or flying through the world, animals are constantly making decisions while on the move—decisions that allow them to choose where to eat, where to hide, and with whom to associate. Despite this most studies have considered only on the outcome of, and time taken to make, decisions. Motion is, however, crucial in terms of how space is represented by organisms during spatial decision-making. Employing a range of new technologies, including automated tracking, computational reconstruction of sensory information, and immersive ‘holographic’ virtual reality (VR) for animals, experiments with fruit flies, locusts and zebrafish (representing aerial, terrestrial and aquatic locomotion, respectively), I will demonstrate that this time-varying representation results in the emergence of new and fundamental geometric principles that considerably impact decision-making. Specifically, we find that the brain spontaneously reduces multi-choice decisions into a series of abrupt (‘critical’) binary decisions in space-time, a process that repeats until only one option—the one ultimately selected by the individual—remains. Due to the critical nature of these transitions (and the corresponding increase in ‘susceptibility’) even noisy brains are extremely sensitive to very small differences between remaining options (e.g., a very small difference in neuronal activity being in “favor” of one option) near these locations in space-time. This mechanism facilitates highly effective decision-making, and is shown to be robust both to the number of options available, and to context, such as whether options are static (e.g. refuges) or mobile (e.g. other animals). In addition, we find evidence that the same geometric principles of decision-making occur across scales of biological organisation, from neural dynamics to animal collectives, suggesting they are fundamental features of spatiotemporal computation.

    <EventDescription>Often times, biomedical datasets have lots of nearly redundant information, such as two very similar compounds having nearly the same binding energy. This can lead to inflated performance metrics and models that are not generalizable for novel predictions. It is useful to characterize these datasets to understand the potential for this happening and attempt to mitigate it. This talk discusses the redundancy in drug binding data repositories, methods to characterize the similarities within a dataset, and ways to diminish the biases from over and underrepresented data. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Every day, over 28,000 people are diagnosed with dementia, making it a leading cause of death and economic burden worldwide. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our best defence against AD has, until recently, been insights gathered from experiments using mice and numerous such experiments have studied the fundamental importance of the brain's clearance mechanisms. Mathematical modelling has joined the fight against AD and allows for safe, ethical, and cost-effective in-silico experimentation in man. My research delivers the first theoretical model of coupled brain clearance and AD progression, and my data-driven computational approach simulates 40 years of AD progression in less than 14 seconds of computational time.
In this talk, I will describe a new model of AD and its coupled relationship with brain clearance. The resulting high-dimensional, network diffusion-reaction dynamical system yields theoretical insights into the neurodegeneration process and its relationship with clearance. Computational results, on high-resolution brain graphs constructed from the data of 426 patients, demonstrate the connection between clearance and AD progression. A key finding is that the coupling between proteopathic spreading and regional brain clearance may not only alter the trajectory of AD but also provide a potential window into understanding AD subtypes. AD research is changing, and mathematics is providing the critical bridge from mice to machine to man.

    <EventDescription>Cells in tissue can communicate short-range via direct contact, and long-range via diffusive signals. In addition, another class of cell-cell communication is by long, thin cellular protrusions that are ~100 microns in length and ~100 nanometers in width. These so-called non-canonical protrusions include cytonemes, nanotubes, and airinemes. But, before establishing communication, they must find their target cell. Here we demonstrate airinemes in zebrafish are consistent with a finite persistent random walk model. We study this model by stochastic simulation, and by numerically solving the survival probability equation using Strang splitting. The probability of contacting the target cell is maximized for a balance between ballistic search (straight) and diffusive (highly curved, random) search. We find that the curvature of airinemes in zebrafish, extracted from live cell microscopy, is approximately the same value as the optimum in the simple persistent random walk model. We also explore the ability of the target cell to infer direction of the airineme’s source, finding the experimentally observed parameters to be at a Pareto optimum balancing directional sensing with contact initiation.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Common dryland vegetation models exhibit bistability for a certain range of environmental conditions, with an unstable equilibrium separating the basins of attraction of the vegetated and desert states. Random perturbations may lead to irreversible degradation of locally stable vegetated states, either from sufficiently large punctual disturbances or as the result of the cumulated effect of sufficiently frequent repeated alterations. In this talk we consider a mean field vegetation model including common processes in dryland ecology, and investigate how the presence of delay effects might affect recovery and degradation risk after different scenarios of random perturbations. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Mammalian fliers, such as flying squirrels and bats, are known for their use of extensible membranes for gliding and flight. 
These membrane wings adapt their shape passively to unsteady flow conditions, enabling several aerodynamic advantages over rigid wings.
In pursuit of a theoretical model for evaluating these benefits, a theoretical framework is developed to predict the response of a two-dimensional membrane wing to unsteady flow conditions. An extensible membrane model is applied, assuming small camber and constant tension along the membrane, and the aerodynamic load on the airfoil is obtained using unsteady thin airfoil theory, permitting the analysis of vertical gust encounters or prescribed flapping motions.
The membrane structural and lift responses to arbitrary prescribed motions and vertical gusts enable the derivation of extensions to the classical Theodorsen, Wagner, Sears, and K\"{u}ssner functions that represent the rigid airfoil lift response to unsteady flow.
These extensions constitute the first known effort to include membrane fluid-structure interaction in the analytical expressions used to describe the unsteady lift response of a flexible airfoil.

    <EventDescription>I will discuss propulsion by flexible appendages, as in swimming or flying. A small-amplitude flow model combined with an efficient Chebyshev PDE solver and conformal mapping techniques enables efficient numerical solutions. These solutions elucidate the performance benefits garnered by optimizing flexibility characteristics of appendages. The method also generalizes to multiple flapping bodies through the so-called prime function. New results shed light on flow-mediated collective behavior, such as schooling and flocking.

    <EventDescription>Actin cytoskeleton networks generate local topological signatures due to the natural variations in the number, size, and shape of holes of the networks. Persistent homology is a method that explores these topological properties of data and summarizes them as persistence diagrams. In this work, we analyze and classify these filament networks by transforming them into persistence diagrams whose variability is quantified via a Bayesian framework on the space of persistence diagrams. The proposed generalized Bayesian framework adopts an independent and identically distributed cluster point process characterization of persistence diagrams and relies on a substitution likelihood argument. This framework provides the flexibility to estimate the posterior cardinality distribution of points in a persistence diagram and the posterior spatial distribution simultaneously. We present a closed form of the posteriors under the assumption of Gaussian mixtures and binomials for prior intensity and cardinality respectively. Using this posterior calculation, we implement a Bayes factor algorithm to classify the actin filament networks and benchmark it against several state-of-the-art classification methods.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>
The occurrence and mortality of cancer around the world is growing and will continue to grow. Most common cancer treatment approaches include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, all of which work best when the cancer is detected early. Developing systems of early detection of cancer will help to mitigate the negative aspects of cancer treatment since cancer found at an early stage, when it is small and before it has spread to other parts of the body. Cancer cells are known to release little pieces of RNA, known as miRNA, that circulate throughout the body, particularly in the bloodstream. Nanoparticles can be designed to bind to select miRNA. Upon binding, the emission spectrum of the nanoparticle shifts, particularly in the infrared. Infrared light passes quite easily through many tissues, so this system could allow for non-invasive detection of circulating cancer miRNA and potentially improve early diagnosis potential for cancer. The purpose of this research is to use mathematical analysis and computer simulation of mathematical models to study the efficacy of this type of detection system and what parameters make it viable for cancer detection.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Vascular networks deliver nutrients and remove waste from tissues and play a pivotal role in many biological processes, including development and homeostasis. As the structure of vascular networks determines their overall function, we develop and analyze several statistical and topological approaches to quantify morphological patterns observed from data. We highlight the success of these methods through two case studies. In the first, we show that a topological filtration can be used to stratify the parameter space from many simulations of an agent-based model of angiogenesis. In the second case study, we apply statistical and TDA methods to several public datasets of segmented vascular network images and find that both approaches can be used to accurately predict images’ disease status. The methodologies we consider are broadly applicable to biological data that may arise from cancer, wound healing, development, and plant biology.

    <EventDescription>How are patterns of motor activity maintained in neural encodings over time despite ongoing change such as aging, injury, and fluctuations in the brain? Here we address this question by focusing on an animal model for motor learning: the songbird. Our analysis of behavioral and neural data reveals mechanisms to maintain robust song behavior at multiple scales in the songbird system. We develop a Gaussian Process model to examine dopamine neurons’ relationship to natural song in singing, adult birds. Spontaneous dopamine activity correlates with natural variations in song in a manner consistent with song evaluation. We then explore a second form of song maintenance that progresses with minimal behavioral feedback. Type-selective perturbations to neurons within HVC, a motor cortical-like nucleus that contributes to sequence and timing in song production, result in the rapid degradation and recovery of song in adult birds. Remarkably, recovery advances even in the absence of practice. We characterize the behavioral and neural trajectory of this perturbation process and examine though a computational biophysical model of HVC how local, unsupervised mechanisms could restore HVC dynamics without reference to behavioral feedback. This work highlights the cooperation of multiple mechanisms of adaptation and maintenance in sustaining stable motor behaviors.

    <EventDescription>Tick-borne illnesses are trending upward and are an increasing source of risks to people’s health in the United States. Hence, it is important to find a practical way of managing tick populations. Prescribed burns are a common form of land management, it can be cost efficient if properly managed and can be applied across large amounts of land. In this seminar, I will present a spatial stage-structured tick-host model with impulsive differential equations to investigate the effect of prescribed fire intensity, and the duration between burns on tick population and disease prevalence. Results indicate that fire intensity has a larger impact in reducing tick population than frequency between burns. Furthermore, burning at high intensity is preferable to burning at low intensity whenever possible. Exploring the use of prescribed burns in preventing the establishment of ticks into new areas shows that fewer burns are ineffective at preventing their establishment because ticks can recover relatively quickly following a burn. While frequent, long-term prescribed burns slows the propagation of ticks, their possibly establishment is inevitable and the additional use of other tick population management strategies is necessary to prevent their establishment.   </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The ability to accurately forecast the dynamics of a complex oscillating systems is fundamental to the study of many physical and biological systems. This is especially important for understanding and predicting the bodies natural 24 hour oscillations in physiology and behavior known as circadian rhythms. This talk with explore the limitations and strengths of machine learning techniques applied to circadian rhythm forecasting. The fundamental data used in training these models is the response of oscillators to external perturbations which can be traced out into phase response curves for data collected across the period of the oscillator. In this work, we study the application of machine learning techniques to complex nonlinear oscillator systems using phase response training data. Using simulated data we examine how well these techniques perform when the perturbations are generalized from the training data. Finally, we discuss the application of these techniques to the study of circadian rhythms and discuss some preliminary results for using wearable data (apple watch, fitbit) to build personalized models of circadian rhythms.

    <EventDescription>Adaptive systems—such as a biological organism gaining survival advantage or a motor protein transporting intracellular nutrients—must somehow capture predictable structure and identify irrelevant noise in their environment. This is the thermodynamic principle of Requisite Complexity: thermodynamic agents must match the complexity of their environment in order to maximize the production of useful work.  Work production is the most relevant performance measure for an adaptive physical agent, and so maximizing work production corresponds to thermodynamic learning, drawing a direct parallel to the maximum-likelihood principle that guides machine learning.  However, reckless pursuit of maximum work in the training phase easily leads to overfitting, which has dire energetic consequences.  Irreversible entropy production diverges when thermodynamic agents are unconstrained in their pursuit of energetic advantage.  This suggests that functional thermodynamic learning must include physical mechanisms for generalization.

    <EventDescription>The recent development of high-resolution omics level technologies has reshaped modern biological research. These high-dimensional and noisy datasets are accumulating at a fast pace. Efficient and biologically meaningful algorithms are needed to extract biological insights from these raw datasets. In this talk, I will discuss using optimal transport, a powerful geometric data analysis method, to integrate multimodal omics datasets and to infer cell-cell communications, a crucial process that drives the correct developments and functions of biological systems. I will also talk about a new formulation of optimal transport called supervised optimal transport inspired by these biological applications.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The growth of bacterial colony exhibits striking complex patterns and robust scaling laws. Understanding the principles that underlie such growth has far-reaching consequences in biological and health sciences. In this work, we develop a mechanical theory of cell-cell and cell-environmental interactions and construct a hybrid three-dimensional computational model for the growth of E. coli colony on a hard agar surface. Our model consists of microscopic descriptions of the growth, division, and movement of individual cells, and macroscopic diffusion equations for the nutrients. The cell movement is driven by the cellular mechanical interactions. Our large-scale simulations and analysis predict the linear growth of the colony in both the radial and vertical directions in a good agreement with the experimental observations. We find that the mechanical buckling and nutrient penetration are the key factors in determining the underlying growth scalings. This work is the first step toward detailed computational modeling of bacterial growth with mechanical and biochemical interactions. This is joint work with Mya Warren, Hui Sun, Yue Yan, Jonas Cremer, and Terence Hwa.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Given a differential equation model, it is usually of interest to understand which dynamical system behaviors (such as bistable switch-like behavior) are possible as a function of the model parameters. Numerical bifurcation software, such as XPP, can help in this pursuit. However, such software cannot compute an analytic expression for a bifurcation curve of interest in terms of the model parameters. Recently, we have developed a method for finding analytic expressions of bifurcation curves using the resultant. In this talk, I will describe how to find a bifurcation curve from a model of a recently discovered Arabidopsis heat-sensitive epigenetic regulatory network using resultant analysis. A downside to the method is that the associated expression can include many terms and become unwieldy to use in practice. I will also discuss more recent work concerning how to approximate these analytic expressions to find more interpretable expressions in different areas of parameter space.

    <EventDescription>Understanding the growth of plants is fundamental to current efforts in food security and bioenergy, as well as being an interesting biological question in its own right. Cellular level plant growth is driven by a high internal turgor pressure, causing viscous stretching of the cell wall which is combined with new material deposition, whilst growth and emergent morphology at the level of e.g. a root involves coordination across multiple cells and cell files. The cell wall itself is a complex material with a highly ordered microstructure, producing evolving non-linear anisotropic mechanical behaviour that can be manipulated under enzymatic control to alter growth rates at the cellular level, and hence drive macroscale geometric changes at the organ scale. We present a series of mathematical models across multiple spatial scales, from the cell wall microstructure to whole organ level, aiming to elucidate the mechanical mechanisms underpinning plant growth.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In a model organism, we use a combination of computational and experimental tools to tease apart the specific morphogenetic modules of the cardiopharyngeal progenitor cells responsible for forming the heart (and the pharynx). The heart progenitors provide one of the simplest examples of collective cell migration whereby just two cells migrate with defined leader-trailer polarity in between two tissues. The cells are also capable of moving individually, albeit by a shorter distance, with imperfect directionality, and with altered morphology. Thus, maintaining contact and the leader-trailer polarity is important for directed migration to the destination. However, it is unclear why a two-cell system is better at migration than an individual cell. Based on in-vivo fluorescence imaging of the embryo, we obtain morphological measurements of the cells. Borrowing on formulation of active droplet theory, we extract intracellular pressure and forces at the intersection of interfaces (e.g. cell-cell, cell-surface, cell-environment). The 2-cell system migrates persistently due to the difference in contact angle at the leading of the leader cell and trailing edge of the rear cell. We present our biophysical framework and compare the emergent force distributions and speed in the 2-cell system with different perturbations.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Prion proteins are responsible for a variety of fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals but are harmless to Baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae)- making it an ideal system for investigating the protein dynamics associated with prion diseases. Most mathematical frameworks for modeling prion aggregate dynamics either focus on protein dynamics in isolation, absent from a changing cellular environment, or modeling prion aggregate dynamics in a population of cells by considering the "average" behavior. However, such models are unable to reproduce in vivo properties of different yeast prion strains. 

In this talk, I will discuss results from recent cell-based model simulations where we study how factors across scales impact the emergence of population level phenotypes in growing yeast colonies. In particular, the rate of disease onset is related to both the replication and transmission kinetics of propagons, the infectious agents of prion diseases. In the model, each cell has their own configuration of prion aggregates governed by kinetic parameters previously estimated by our group for six different yeast prion strains. We use our model simulations to study how population level phenotypes are a natural consequence of the interplay between the cell cycle, budding cell division and prion aggregate dynamics. We then quantify how common experimentally observed outcomes depend on population heterogeneity.

    <EventDescription>Olfaction is a key sense for many cognitive and behavioral tasks and is particularly unique because odors can naturally enter the nasal cavity from the front or rear, i.e., ortho- and retro-nasal, respectively. Prior imaging studies have shown the brain responds differently to these two modes of stimulation even with identical odors. Yet little is known about the differences in how olfactory bulb (OB) cells process and subsequently transfer this odor information to higher brain. Based on our multi-electrode array recordings of mitral cells in rat OB, we find significant differences between ortho and retro stimulus in trail-averaged population spiking statistics. It is believed that these differences have large implications for how the OB and successive higher brain regions code these modes of stimulation, but our preliminary findings indicate that using trial-averaged population spiking statistics alone to understand coding may be misleading. Using GABA\_A agonists and antagonists, we find too little or too much inhibition can reduce average coding accuracy of ortho vs retro odors in OB. Specifically, excess inhibition is found to increase the difference in ortho versus retro firing rate while also reducing coding accuracy. We are currently developing a computational rate model based on our MC data to better understand the inhibitory effects on coding accuracy.

    <EventDescription>One-dimensional discrete-time population models, such as for logistic or Ricker growth, exhibit periodic and chaotic dynamics. Adding epidemiological interactions into the system increases its dimension and the resulting complexity of its behaviors. Previous work showed that while a discrete SIR model with Ricker growth exhibits qualitatively similar total population dynamics in the presence and absence of disease, a more complicated viral infection (SIV) system does not. Instead, infection in the SIV system shifts the periodic behavior of the system in a manner that distinguishes it from the corresponding disease-free system. Here, we examine a SI model with Ricker population growth and show that infection produces a distinctly different bifurcation structure than that of the underlying disease-free system. We use analytic and numerical bifurcation analysis to determine the influence of infection on the bifurcation structure of the system. In addition, we derive the basic reproductive number and determine the influence of population growth and decay parameters on. Our work shows that even in the SI model, infection dynamics can shift the location of period-doubling bifurcations as well as the onset of chaos.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>When red blood cells (RBCs) experience non-physiologically high stresses, e.g., in medical devices, they can rupture in a process called hemolysis. Directly simulating this process is computationally unaffordable given that the length scales of a medical device are several orders of magnitude larger than that of a RBC. To overcome this separation of scales, the present work introduces an affordable computational framework that accurately resolves the stress and deformation of a RBC in a spatially and temporally varying macroscale flow field such as those found in a typical medical device. The underlying idea of the present framework is to treat RBCs as one-way coupled tracers in the macroscale flow and resolve the fluid velocity in their immediate vicinity as well as the motion of the membrane by employing the boundary integral method coupled to a structural solver. The governing equations are discretized in space using spherical harmonics, yielding spectral integration accuracy. The predictions produced by this formulation are in good agreement with those obtained from simulations of spherical capsules in shear flows and optical tweezers experiments. The accuracy of the present method is evaluated using unbounded shear flow as a benchmark. Its computational cost grows proportional to $p^5$, where $p$ is the degree of the spherical harmonic. It also exhibits a fast convergence rate that is approximately $O(p^6)$ for $p \le 20$.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>One of the fundamental questions around the human circulatory system is to determine how blood flow can be distributed when and where it is needed. For example, J. Wan and his colleagues[1] very recently showed that cerebral functional hyperemia is initiated in the capillaries with RBCs acting as oxygen sensors to regulate cerebral blood flow. In this case, the interactions between deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) and band 3 protein in the RBC membrane are the molecular switch that responds to local PO2 changes.  RBC deformability is largely governed by the membrane shear modulus.  State-of-the-art microfluidic platforms for high-throughput measurements of RBC mechanical properties have not enabled measurement of the shear modulus heretofore. These limitations challenge the development of diagnostic devices based on RBC shear modulus biomarkers.   In this talk, we will review the development of our high-throughput microfluidic platform to address this significant gap in technology[2]. Our approach allows us to measure the shear modulus of individual RBCs and generate shear modulus distributions including measurements of thousands of cells in minutes. We will then discuss the modification of our platform to make similar measurements but at controlled PO2 saturation levels in the blood.

    <EventDescription>The cell cortex is a key regulator for the cell's shape and its functions, for instance during cell division. It shows elastic properties on short timescales and viscous properties on longer timescales. Hence to properly simulate it, a viscoelastic model covering the whole viscous to elastic spectrum is needed. Using the GENERIC framework we developed the surface equivalent of the upper convected Maxwell model. In this talk we present our numerical implementation of a viscoelastic surface embedded in a viscous fluid. We use this model to simulate the influence of active surface tension or other surface forces on the cell cortex. An example of which are the counter rotating flows observed during cytokinesis. We study the influence of these and how changing the viscoelastic parameters changes cell shape and the distribution of a surface bound molecule concentration. We observe that these counter rotating flows can promote a ring of high molecule concentration which could facilitate cell division.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The thalamus is a body of neural cells that relays impulses to the cerebral cortex from the sensory pathways.  Feedback from the cortex gives rise to thalamo-cortical loops that generate emergent brain rhythms from the interplay of single cell ionic currents and network mechanisms.  Here we discuss parsimonious models of cortex and thalamus using different types of nonlinear integrate-and-fire unit.  The integrate-and-fire-or-burst model is a natural choice for building a model thalamus (from networks of relay and reticular cells) that can intrinsically oscillate via post-inhibitory rebound (mediated by a slow T-type calcium current) whilst the cortex can be more simply modelled using a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons.  In both cases we discuss the reduction to a lower dimensional mean-field model, utilising a separation of time-scales argument for slow synaptic interactions in the thalamus model, and the Ott-Antonsen ansatz for the cortical model.  The resulting firing rate equations for both brain organs are coupled to form a thalamo-cortical loop model.  The relevance of this model for understanding brain response to sensory drive is highlighted with a comparison to human neuroimaging data for median nerve stimulation.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Atherosclerosis has been a primary cause of potentially fatal cardiac diseases, like coronary artery heart disease and many more. It has been a subject of many investigations for decades. However, intimal growth due to fluid(blood)-structure(blood vessels) interaction is less studied. This lecture will focus on intimal growth in arteries, induced by hemodynamical shear stress. Growth is modeled using morphoelasticity theory, assuming endothelial cells release PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) in a shear-dependent manner. Blood flow is highly idealized (it is unidirectional with a no-slip boundary condition at the endothelium; it remains constant as the vessel deforms; it is steady and non-turbulent). Each of the three layers of an artery has transversely helical collagen fibers associated with them. These transversely helical collagen fibers play an important role in determining the rate of growth of the intima. The fiber fields in the three arterial layers are simulated numerically using conformal maps. The optimal growth is found by minimizing a strain-energy function that consists of a neo-Hookean term, an exponential term that registers the anisotropy induced by the collagen fibers, a penalty term that penalizes large deformations, and an auxiliary term that ensures that the deformation in a stress-free configuration is zero. This model should be viewed as providing a framework for coupling more fully 3D hemodynamics simulations to disease progression.

    <EventDescription>The evolution of cooperation has been studied in many systems, from bacterial communities to human populations. It is well known that population structure is crucial to a system's dynamics. In human populations, group memberships are fundamental. Humans meet and interact with each other based in large part upon their common group memberships. From a theoretical perspective, there exist network-based models to study human dynamics, but they generally do not allow for multiple group affiliations or incorporate barriers to group entry. In this work, we present a generalized framework, based on evolutionary set theory, in which individuals are distributed across groups. These individuals interact, through an evolutionary game, with those who share their groups. The system updates stochastically, with strategy and group memberships subject to evolutionary updating. We impose realistic group membership rules, including flexibility in the number of memberships and barriers to group entry. We find that with these rules, cooperation can emerge, but that it is most favored when we allow for the existence of ``loners": a changing subset of individuals who spend a temporary ``time-out" period not interacting with others. This work provides an analytical framework in which behavior in realistic population structures can be studied, and adds to a growing body of literature that recognizes the existence of loners as vital parts of systems.

    <EventDescription>Social bees play an integral role in enhancing agricultural sustainability and ecosystem preservation. The recent decline of social bee colonies highlights the value in understanding possible causes. Environmental stressors that interfere with social bee behavior and efficiency have been identified through mathematical models and empirical experiments as a potential cause for colony collapse. We model impairment due to stressors through a traditional disease modeling framework, building on existing mathematical models by stratifying the colony by impairment and caste. Further, we generalize the attributes of stressors such as their transmissibility, impairment level, lethality, and temporal-occurrence. Our model underscores the importance of further investigation into the various attributes of sublethal stressors as a cause for colony collapse.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>A glider moving in a turbulent flow will continuously lose energy via drag. 
To balance this loss in energy and soar, energy must be continuously extracted from the flow, either by localizing in stable ascending currents (thermal soaring) or in a stable shear region (dynamic soaring). Recent observations of soaring birds show convoluted trajectories distinct from characteristic patterns exhibited during thermal and dynamic soaring, raising the intriguing possibility that energy can be extracted purely from transient ascending currents or shear. In this work, we simulate gliders navigating in a turbulent flow, which use their past experience to infer a strongly fluctuating flow field and actively make decisions. We build the decision-making component using a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), which exploits an adaptive filtering and prediction system to consider many paths into the future and execute a trajectory that maximizes the energy gained. 
We demonstrate the ability of gliders to extract energy from the flow, and identify the significant factors necessary for effective turbulent navigation.

    <EventDescription>Recent advances of single-cell technologies, in particular single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial imaging, provide an unprecedented opportunity for probing underlying intercellular communications that often drive heterogeneity and cell state transitions in tissues. In this talk, I will show our recent efforts in modeling and analyzing cell-cell communication from the high-throughput sequencing data. We developed an integrated method CellChat for systematic inference and quantitative analysis of cell-cell communication by integrating scRNA-seq data and prior knowledge of the interactions between signaling molecules. I will show how we can quantitatively build and analyze cell-cell communication networks in an easily interpretable way by applying systems biology and machine learning approaches. Furthermore, by leveraging spatial information from spatial transcriptomics, we developed a computational approach for inferring niche programs that capture the underlying cell-cell communication patterns and reveal how cells and signals coordinates together for function.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>``Sea squirts", such as the tunicate {\em Ciona savignyi}, are marine invertebrates with valveless, tubular hearts. They are widely regarded as model organisms for studying the development of vertebrate chambered hearts.  Sea squirts also exhibit a bizarre phenomenon: after every minute or two of unidirectional pumping of blood, they can {\em reverse} the direction of blood flow.  What mechanisms might underlie this odd behavior?  How can we model the reversals mathematically, and what insights might this offer regarding our own hearts?

To address these questions, we idealize the tubular heart as a one-dimensional excitable fiber driven by multiple pacemakers, and use an impulsively forced reaction-diffusion system to model action potential (AP) propagation. Because the reversal phenomenon can be understood through careful tracking of APs, we use perturbation methods to reduce the reaction-diffusion equations to a fully kinematic model of AP propagation.  The kinematic model facilitates parameter estimation from experimental data, as well as derivation of simple mathematical criteria for reversals to occur. The models can easily replicate experimentally observed reversals while offering some clues regarding the underlying mechanisms.  We conclude by discussing planned future work, including the use of optical mapping and micro-particle image velocimetry experiments to inform models coupling electrophysiology, circulation, and muscle contraction.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Intracardiac fluid factors contribute to heart development, but their mechanosensory role remains poorly understood in aorticopulmonary (AP) septum development and defects. The AP septum divides the outflow tract into the aortic artery and pulmonary trunk. Ablating AP septum precursors alters blood flow and leads to outflow tract defects. In fact, shortly after precursor removal, hemodynamic changes precede major defects. However, there are limited data of blood velocity, pressure, and wall shear stress (WSS) in the outflow tract under both normal and ablated conditions. Due to the constant pumping and small size of the embryonic heart, WSS can not always be measured \textit{in vivo} and is often roughly approximated. I develop computational models of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of the embryonic chick heart that reveal the precise spatial and temporal patterning of WSS in the outflow tract during AP septum development under various hemodynamic conditions. First, I manually elevate WSS in the embryonic chick by elevating hematocrit levels and construct the FSI model from the resulting morphology to observe WSS patterns. In the second portion of this study, I compare WSS patterns in outflow tracts of chicks that had distinct subpopulations of AP septal precursors ablated. The goals of the study are to establish the first detailed hemodynamic profiles throughout both the embryonic heart and aortic arches under normal and altered blood flow that lead to AP septal defects.

    <EventDescription>In 2021, immunotherapies surpassed other therapeutic cancer interventions by having the largest number of approved drugs. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, remain a major area of immunotherapy exploration. While monotherapies show success in certain patients, for others, they fail. This may be because combination treatment is required, the drug is ill-suited for that cancer type, or it’s the wrong treatment for that specific patient. Mathematical modeling can help address these issues by improving understanding of immune interactions and maximizing clinical response through optimization of drug combinations and dosing schedules. It can also be used to predict patient-specific outcomes and determine biomarkers for treatment success.

Current trends are geared towards ensuring data-driven mathematical models are translatable to different levels of drug development from the laboratory to the hospital. Key ongoing challenges include understanding the competition between healthy and cancer cells, complementing clinical trials to determine effective therapy combinations, and the role of the spatial distribution of the tumor microenvironment. 

This minisymposium, ranging from the white board to the white coats, features immunotherapy models that include immune checkpoint inhibition in the context of cancers such as glioblastoma, melanoma, and lung cancer.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Transitions between dynamic states are ubiquitous across all scales of life, from cell differentiation during development to the desertification of the Amazon rainforest. These transitions may be regarded as emergent, transient behavior of a representative dynamical system. Traditionally, such systems have been analyzed by considering their asymptotic behavior, overlooking transient behavior. In the natural sciences, however, transient behavior has been shown to be a critical player in a wide range of systems, particularly, given that living systems are constantly changing.

This minisymposium will showcase and explore new theoretical results on dynamical transitions in nonlinear systems and their applications including, but not limited to development, neuroscience, neuroendocrinology, ecosystems, and climate. The minisymposium will be organized in two parts. The first will consider transitions in systems comprising single elements, such as individual cells or proteins. The second will investigate transitions across networks of dynamic interacting nodes, such as those observed in neuronal networks.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Across the human lifespan, sleep-wake behavior undergoes significant changes, from multiple sleeps per day during infancy and early childhood to consolidated adult sleep schedules. Throughout these transitions, the circadian rhythm sculpts the timing of sleep to entrain to the 24 h environmental light cycle. However, modern society offers many ways that humans perturb and modify their entrainment to the day-night cycle, including artificial light, melatonin supplements and shift work schedules. Mathematical modeling of sleep-wake regulation and circadian clocks are greatly contributing to understanding underlying mechanisms of sleep and circadian processes and predicting responses to environmental and external perturbations. Sleep-wake regulation models account for the interactions of wake- and sleep-promoting neural populations, under modulation by the homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm, in dictating timing and durations of sleep episodes. Classic circadian rhythm models represent circadian signaling as a limit cycle under modulation of the external light cycle, while more recent models account for the network interactions of clock cells within the suprachiasmatic nucleus generating the circadian signal. The talks in this minisymposium present analyses of sleep-wake regulation and circadian rhythm models to reveal dynamics dictating sleep behavior in different developmental stages and to understand responses to external perturbations of the circadian rhythm.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Plants exhibit many complex behaviors including plant growth, seed germination, seasonal flowering, nyctinasty, and vernalization. Initiation of these behaviors is typically cued by environmental information sources, such as light and temperature. Many mathematical frameworks and tools have been used to study plant processes, including bifurcation theory, deterministic and stochastic differential equations, biomechanical modeling, machine learning frameworks, and population and ecological modeling. This mini-symposium will feature researchers using different mathematical modeling techniques to study environmentally-cued plant behaviors. The session will be broken down into four talks as follows:

1. Rosemary Dyson, University of Birmingham, presentation title: Mechanical models of plant growth.

2. Cody FitzGerald, Northwestern University, presentation title: Bifurcation analysis of an environmentally-cued gene regulatory network in Arabidopsis. 

3. Fred Adler, University of Utah, presentation title: Plant mutualisms are ubiquitous and difficult to model

4. Akiko Satake, Kyushu University, presentation title: Forecasting flowering time under warming climates by modeling epigenetic memory in the vernalization pathway.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The role of the circulation is to provide efficient transport of oxygen and nutrients to every tissue of the body.  Modeling this transport can be challenging due to the multiphase nature of blood and the complex geometries through which blood flows. Nonetheless, models at multiple scales have yielded important insight into the transport of oxygen and the motion of individual red blood cells in complex vessel geometries and/or microfluidic devices.  In this minisymposium, theoretical models are presented that predict the contributions of blood flow regulation mechanisms, red blood cell distribution, and oxygen transport to blood flow dynamics.  For example, the uneven partitioning of red blood cells at vessel bifurcations can lead to heterogeneous red blood cell distributions. These factors, combined with the complex structure of vascular networks, can yield non-uniform tissue oxygenation.  This minisymposium (i) highlights models that simulate the impact of mechanics, hemodynamics, and oxygenation on cardiovascular, ocular, and neural function, and (ii) describes how red blood cell properties impact the transport of red blood cells throughout the microvasculature and in microfluidic devices.  Several of the models integrate experimental or clinical observations in applications including peripheral arterial disease, glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, aneurysms, and stroke.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cell migration is essential for critical processes, such as embryonic development and organogenesis, cancer metastasis and circulation, wound healing and immune infiltration. Even in overall non-motile states, cell motility in neuronal plasticity and mucosal transport in the respiratory airway are just a couple of examples of subcellular deformation/shape changes with important physiological functionality of homeostasis and adaptation.

When migrating in complex three-dimensional environments, physical and biochemical signals lead to cytoskeletal rearrangements with potentially large deformations. In the coupled dynamics of mechanics, electrophysiology, metabolism, and signaling, mathematical modeling and simulation are useful tools to identify underlying principles in complex spatiotemporal systems.

This minisymposium expects to expand our understanding from the molecule level of cell-ECM and cell-cell interactions scaled up to coarse-grained and homogenized continuum descriptions of macroscopic dramatic movement satisfying thermodynamics as well as model- and system-specific generation of hypotheses.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The vast majority of cellular functions depend critically on the dynamics of intracellular components, ranging from ions and small metabolites to proteins and micron-scale organelles. Participants in this minisymposium will investigate the dynamics of various intracellular environment across scales. The mathematical models used to investigate these processes involve deterministic PDEs, stochastic particle-based approaches, and agent-based simulations which will be studied by novel numerical methods, parameter-fitting using image data, and analytical approaches. In several cases, these modeling studies will be closely coupled to single-molecule imaging assays, which are commonly used to calibrate model parameters and improve model accuracy. In particular, topics include:
1. Influence of the endothelial surface layer on the motion of red blood cells.
2. Maturation of centrosomes in the early C. elegans embryo.
3. Microtubule dynamics and polarity in dendrites of neurons.
4. Effect of heterogenous Endoplasmic Reticulum network morphology on diffusive spreading of membrane proteins at Endoplasmic Reticulum exit sites.
5. Optimal curvature of airinemes in zebrafish in long-range cell-cell communication.
6. Effective pairwise interactions in collective motion models of chromosomes moving around during mitosis.
7. Small time-scale reaction-diffusion catalytic processes.
8. Motor-driven intracellular transport along cytoskeletal networks.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Multiscale, mathematical models developed in combination with experiments, provide a framework for testing new mechanisms that would otherwise be experimentally intractable. Moreover, accurate and systematic parameter calibration at different biological scales is necessary for revealing the complex, non-intuitive relationships between known and unknown factors affecting the system under investigation. In this minisymposium, we bring together a diverse group of leading researchers in the field who use experimental data at different scales to develop and calibrate multiscale, mathematical and computational models. Special attention will be given to both model development and calibration techniques in order to exchange ideas and encourage further development of novel multiscale models.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Interactions between individual agents drive the emergence of rich group dynamics across biological scales, with applications spanning intracellular transport, tissue formation and regeneration, disease spread, and insect swarms. In all of these applications, scientists are interested in uncovering normal agent behavior and predicting the changes to group-level properties that will emerge under altered interactions. This general goal is complicated by the fact that detailed models of complex systems can have many parameters; emergence is a stochastic and imperfect process; and data on complex systems is often qualitative or composed of many confounding factors. Motivated by these challenges, our session brings together researchers developing topological techniques, data-driven approaches for model selection and development, and mechanistic models to understand complex biological systems. Our goal is to highlight complementary approaches to the challenges in complex-systems research and lead to cross-fertilization between mathematical sub-fields.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>One of the crucial questions in neuroscience is how neural networks in the brain encode/decode sensory information from the external world. This field has matured to a state that now requires clever experiments in concert with data-driven modeling and theory to make significant impacts. This session will exhibit some of the latest work on sensory coding, featuring speakers who all work at the interface of neuroscience experiments and modeling/theory. The focus is generally on how network attributes (topdown modulation, connections, inputs, etc.) promote efficient coding. The sensory systems range from vision, auditory, olfactory and beyond, but are united by fundamental neural coding questions.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Physiological systems constructed of individual nodes (cells) form networks (tissues).  Emergent properties from these networks are often the basis for normal behavior, and disruption of these properties from the cellular to the system level can lead to dysfunction and disease.  We (1) describe phenomena in the brain from neuroendocrine cells and their networks to the blood brain barrier and overarching brain rhythms, and (2) explore behaviors that can impact glucose modulation from individual calcium dynamics within cells to islet networks and system wide homeostasis.  The mini-symposium is held in honor of Arthur Sherman’s 70th Birthday. He is a pioneer in the modeling and analysis of systems like these.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cardiac arrhythmias are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality and are caused by various physiological or structural factors, ranging from changes in a single ion channel gene to tissue-scale phenomena. One of the most important goals of cardiac modeling is integrating disparate data into coherent models that can replicate and predict the effects of changes in the electrical conduction substrate at the large-scale cardiac tissue level. Such electrical models are crucial in understanding cardiac arrhythmias, as well as in testing and proposing new treatments that shift activity back to the physiological state. This minisymposium gathers researchers with specialties from across the disparate scales relevant for cardiac dynamics to consider the impact of modelling on the development, identification, and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Surface active agents (such as surfactants or lipids) are amphiphilic molecules with different affinity to solvents: hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails. These amphiphilic systemsare able to form supramolecular structures across many length scales from nanometer to micrometer to reduce unfavorable energetic interactions. Dynamics of lipid bilayer in vivo involves multiscale interactions with surrounding fluid and other macromolecular complexes. To date, grand challenges remain in high-fidelity modeling and efficient computation of the self-assembly process, specifically composition variations, large deformation and topological changes of membrane induced by multiscale electrostatic, entropic, hydrodynamics, and mechanical interactions. This minisymposium will (1) address some of the most interesting topics in modeling of bilayer membranes, including coupling of asymmetric bilayers, protein insertion and pore formation, pattern formation, multicomponent coupling, fluid-vesicle
coupling, fluid-electrostatics-vesicle coupling, and fast algorithms; (2) nurture collaborations among investigators in applied and computational mathematics, biophysics, and mechanical engineering.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Organized macroscopic phenomena in biology typically arise out of the co-ordinated interaction of microscopic constituents. Usually there is a considerable amount of noise and disorder at the microscopic level, so that statistical mechanics techniques are necessary to determine how the microscopic constituents shape the macroscopic behavior.
Frequently the macroscopic phenomena remain noisy, and a major challenge is to understand the effect of this noise on the macroscopic patterns. This minisymposium consists of work that finds novel ways of understanding the effect of noise on patterns. Christian Kuehn analyzes the effect of space-time white noise on PDE's supporting rotating solutions. He determines a low-dimensional equation describing the effect of the white noise on the phase of the pattern, and determines accurate estimates for the diffusion of the pattern phase / location over long time periods. Jay Newby studies the effect of strong noise on limit cycles. He finds that the noise can elicit much strange behavior: including reversed rotation and bi-stability. Pedro Vilanova studies the effect of common noise on (otherwise independent) stochastic oscillators: determining a deeper understanding of when the noise is strong enough to synchronize the phases. Moshe Silverstein determines population-density equations for neural networks of balanced excitation and inhibition.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The role of the circulation is to provide efficient transport of oxygen and nutrients to every tissue of the body.  Modeling this transport can be challenging due to the multiphase nature of blood and the complex geometries through which blood flows. Nonetheless, models at multiple scales have yielded important insight into the transport of oxygen and the motion of individual red blood cells in complex vessel geometries and/or microfluidic devices.  In this minisymposium, theoretical models are presented that predict the contributions of blood flow regulation mechanisms, red blood cell distribution, and oxygen transport to blood flow dynamics.  For example, the uneven partitioning of red blood cells at vessel bifurcations can lead to heterogeneous red blood cell distributions. These factors, combined with the complex structure of vascular networks, can yield non-uniform tissue oxygenation.  This minisymposium (i) highlights models that simulate the impact of mechanics, hemodynamics, and oxygenation on cardiovascular, ocular, and neural function, and (ii) describes how red blood cell properties impact the transport of red blood cells throughout the microvasculature and in microfluidic devices.  Several of the models integrate experimental or clinical observations in applications including peripheral arterial disease, glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, aneurysms, and stroke.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cell migration is essential for critical processes, such as embryonic development and organogenesis, cancer metastasis and circulation, wound healing and immune infiltration. Even in overall non-motile states, cell motility in neuronal plasticity and mucosal transport in the respiratory airway are just a couple of examples of subcellular deformation/shape changes with important physiological functionality of homeostasis and adaptation.

When migrating in complex three-dimensional environments, physical and biochemical signals lead to cytoskeletal rearrangements with potentially large deformations. In the coupled dynamics of mechanics, electrophysiology, metabolism, and signaling, mathematical modeling and simulation are useful tools to identify underlying principles in complex spatiotemporal systems.

This minisymposium expects to expand our understanding from the molecule level of cell-ECM and cell-cell interactions scaled up to coarse-grained and homogenized continuum descriptions of macroscopic dramatic movement satisfying thermodynamics as well as model- and system-specific generation of hypotheses.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Mathematical modeling is a vital tool to gain valuable information on the dynamics of epidemics and the sustainability of ecosystems. Qualitative and quantitative mathematical analyses enable us to examine different situations and outcomes that are costly, difficult, and/or impossible to get experimentally. Despite significant achievements in the development of new modeling approaches to address applied needs, there are still many open issues that demand their urgent solution and justify further adjustment and study of both deterministic and stochastic models.  
The talks of this mini-symposium will focus on resolving some open problems in modeling and control of nonlinear behavioral processes in epidemiology and ecological sciences, spread, and mitigation of infectious diseases. The topics will cover analytical models and numerical simulation, deterministic and stochastic contiguous models, discrete, among other tools. All talks will be of interest to mathematicians and researchers working in the related applied areas.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogenous disease that is defined by its lack of estrogen hormone, progesterone hormone and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The lack of receptors frequently results in poorer outcomes, higher rates of metastasis and recurrence since there are no viable targeted therapies. Combination chemotherapy treatments, radiation therapies, and surgery are the current standard-of-care for TNBC. We have built an ordinary differential equation model of TNBC and its response to a combination of chemotherapies, doxorubicin (DRB) and paclitaxel (PTX). This model was parameterized to longitudinal tumor volume and proliferation data, then validated using percent necrosis data for both a human cancer mouse model (MDA-MB-231) as well as a syngeneic, mammary carcinoma (4T1) mouse model. This novel mathematical model can give insight to the ordering, dosing, and timing of DRB and PTX treatment. More importantly, this model can also give insight to vital immunotherapies for TNBC, that we would not otherwise receive, due to its calibration to the syngeneic, mammary carcinoma (4T1) mouse model.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Epithelial tubes are key building blocks of life, yet their morphogenesis is poorly understood. A particularly important example is the neural tube, a precursor for the central nervous system. Given the severe medical consequences of neural tube defects, which affect approximately 1:1000 births, it is pivotal to understand the biomechanics of mammalian spinal neurulation.

The folding neural tube shows a transition from medial to dorsolateral bending sites ("hingepoints") along the embryo's body axis. These hingepoints are commonly considered active driving forces in neural tube closure, although the causation remains largely unclear. In this presentation, I will show how a recently developed biomechanical model has flipped this view upside down. In computer simulations combining mesoderm expansion, non-neural ectoderm expansion, zippering, and neural plate adhesion to the notochord, hingepoints emerge as passive mechanical byproducts in response to neural-plate-extrinsic forces. Our simulations are based on tissue dimensions measured in mouse and human, and recapitulate the different folding modes along the embryo's body axis, explaining their morphogenesis from a new perspective.

    <EventDescription>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is the implantation of an artificial heart valve that is mounted on a stent, which is crimped in a catheter and guided through the patient’s arteries to the heart without an open-heart surgery. Computer modeling and simulation (CM&amp;S) is an emerging tool in the process of TAVR device design, regulatory approval, and indication in the care of specific patients, since there are still many open questions surrounding post-implantation complications. This talk will present a computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model of Medtronic’s $\textit{CoreValve Evolut R}$ TAVR device based on a hyperelastic finite element extension of the immersed boundary (IB) method. We then perform dynamic simulations of crimping and deployment of the CoreValve, as well as device behavior across the cardiac cycle in a patient-specific aortic root geometry reconstructed from CT image data of a patient at UNC hospital. We will demonstrate that our CoreValve model behaves realistically under physiological in vivo simulation conditions. All simulations are conducted in IBAMR, which is an open-source software developed and maintained by Boyce Griffith’s Cardiovascular Modeling and Simulation laboratory at UNC Chapel Hill.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>During mitosis, ordinary cells with extra centrosomes fail to divide; however, cancer cells retain the ability to divide despite having supernumerary centrosomes. The clustering and movement of centrosomes can determine the viability of such cells. Existing force-balance models track the dynamics of centrosome movement, but they naively account for the fluid-structure interaction between organelles and extracellular fluid. The interaction of microtubules with centrosomes and other cellular structures is one of the main factors driving centrosome movement. This includes microtubule (de)polymerization, the interaction between individual microtubules and the interaction of microtubules with the cellular membrane or organelles. Thus, we are interested in modeling microtubule dynamics and the microtubule-fluid interaction. Using a Kirchhoff rod model and the method of regularized Stokeslets, we contribute a model of microtubule (de)polymerization. We also present a preliminary examination of the interaction between several microtubules, and the drag of a centrosome with attached microtubules in free space.

    <EventDescription>The study of the synchronization patterns in biological processes is a
growing discipline. Small networks of neurons model central pattern
generators (CPG) that control insect locomotion (see doi
10.1137/17M1125571 and doi 10.1137/040607563).

Here, we study small CPGs (6-neuron model) for insect locomotion where
each neuron follows the Hodgkin-Huxley like model of Ghigliazza-Holmes
(introduced in doi 10.1137/040607563). A first key point is the
development of ``roadmap' with exhaustive information on the dynamical
behavior of a single neuron (see doi 10.1016/j.cnsns.2019.105047),
using Spike-counting diagrams and bifurcation analysis.

Then, we analyze the complete system, performing automatic detection
techniques combined with quasi-Monte-Carlo
sweeping methodologies and continuation techniques. These
methods allow us to obtain a complete scheme of the patterns evolution
on the movement gaits of the insect and to
explain which bifurcations create and destroy the different routes
leading to a global dominance of the tripod gait on the fast movement
regime (see doi 10.1016/j.cnsns.2019.105047 and
doi 10.1016/j.neucom.2020.06.151).

    <EventDescription>Understanding how structure and dynamics of neurons impact their function is an essential neuroscience question. We use mathematical modeling techniques to study three specialized neuron types in the auditory brainstem: medial superior olive (MSO) and lateral superior olive (LSO) in mammals, and nucleus laminaris (NL) in birds. MSO and NL neurons are exquisitely sensitive to sub-millisecond time differences in their inputs.  These time differences can reflect relative delays in arrivals of sounds at the two ears and thus carry sound source location information. Recent lines of evidence also indicate LSO neurons are time-difference sensitive. In short, these neurons act as coincidence detectors. We use a two-compartment structure to represent the electrical connection between synaptic input and integration regions of the neuron (soma and dendrite regions) and spike-generating regions (axon initial segment and axon), with compartment dynamics informed by physiological data. We systematically vary the connection between the regions (a two-parameter space) to identify effects of coupling configuration on dynamics and function. In all three cell types, we find that electrical separation between the two regions improves coincidence detection sensitivity. We will review our results and delineate how these different neuron types perform a similar neural computation (sound localization via coincidence detection) using distinct structural, synaptic, and dynamic features.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>One of the most important properties of the dynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is persistence. This property means that initially present chemical species will never tend toward extinction. In particular, chemical reaction network theory provides various conditions for determining persistence in a CRN without time delays. On the other hand, since some reactions in many CRNs often consist of stepwise reactions, the time delays in the reactions cannot be ignored for analyzing the dynamics of the systems. In the previous work, we have given a sufficient condition for a CRN with discrete time delays to be persistent, that is, any positive solution to the delay differential equation (DDE) describing the time evolution of concentrations of species in the system does not approach the boundary of the positive orthant. We also have proven that persistence implies consistence for a CRN with time delays. Recently, a CRN model with distributed time delays has been proposed by G.Lipták et al. (2019). Although a distributed time delay gives the more realistic model than a discrete one, any condition of persistence given in the CRNT has not been generalized to the case of distributed time delays as long as we know. In the presentation, by characterizing the positivity of states in the omega limit set of the distributed DDE as a subset of the functional space, we try to extend the two results proven in the case of discrete time delays to the case of distributed one.

    <EventDescription>Plenty of researches have been devoted to pursuit-evasion games, namely [Leon A. Petrosyan, Differential Pursuit Games, Izdat. Leningrad. Univ., Leningrad, 1977], [Mehdi Salimi, Massimiliano Ferrara (2019): Differential game of optimal pursuit of one evader by many pursuers, International Journal of Game Theory, 48 (2), 481-490]. In this research study, first we investigate a pursuit-evasion differential game with one evader and infinite number of pursuers in Hilbert space. The control functions of players are subjected to the geometric and integral constraint. Evader can scape from pursuers if there exists a strategy of the evader such that geometric point of evader and pursuers are different at any time for any admissible controls of the pursuers. We make a strategy for the evader that ensures scaping it from all pursuers. In the second part of the research, we introduce a winning strategy for pursuers.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Flocking birds exhibit complex dynamic behavior such as wave propagation, coordinated turns, and consistent geometric patterns of tens of thousands of individuals. Understanding this behavior may inform diverse topics such as microscopic biological systems that display similar behavior and self-organization of autonomous robots. However, the properties required for individual birds to create such group dynamics are still not well understood. To understand how complex flocking behaviors like murmuration can develop, we utilize several original and extended flocking models in a simulation of thousands of birds that runs and renders in real time with interactive parameter tuning. We discuss our results as well as the suitability of various metrics for quantifying flocking dynamics like murmuration.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>
Misuse and over use of antibiotics has led to bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics. This has resulted in complications in treatment and treatment failures and is now a major public health challenge. Mathematical models can be very useful in determining efficient and successful antibiotic dosing regimens.  In this study we consider the problem of determining optimal antibiotic dosing, in particular we look at the case where bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics are present in addition to susceptible bacteria. We look at two different models of resistance acquisition, which have been identified as primary mechanisms for in-vivo drug resistance, both involve horizontal transfer of resistant genes from a resistant to a susceptible bacterium. We use a numerical optimization algorithm to determine the 'best' antibiotic dosing strategy, which is successful in eliminating bacteria while keeping the total antibiotic usage low at the same time. We first consider the case where a resistance is acquired via conjugation and then the case where resistance acquisition occurs via transference. We note that constant periodic dosing and dose tapering may not always succeed in eradicating the bacterial populations, while the optimal dosing protocol is successful.

    <EventDescription>The ability to accurately estimate and interpret parameters in mechanistic mathematical models is strongly tied to the quantities of interest (QoIs) for which data is available, the scope of such data, and the structure of the model with respect to its parameters. During calibration, models with more than a few parameters and limited data can exhibit several unidentifiable parameters. This talk presents strategies for combining local parameter sensitivity and identifiability techniques with the numerical solution of inverse problems via optimization to aid in robust parameter estimation and model reduction. Techniques used are based on an eigendecomposition or singular value decomposition involving the sensitivity matrix for QoIs tied to the data. Applications are illustrated for two problems in the mathematical modeling of biological soft tissues. The first application, in biomechanics, considers structural remodeling of the vessel wall in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension using a two-layer nonlinear, hyperelastic, anisotropic Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model. The second application, in wound healing, studies in vitro enzyme-mediated polymerization of fibrinogen into an insoluble fibrin matrix using an enzyme kinetics model with several internal complexes. In both cases, the overall approach is tailored to the application and the capabilities to preserve or enhance objective cost in the optimization while also identifying reduced models is demonstrated.

    <EventDescription>The formation of base pairs within single-stranded RNA molecules, such as viral genomes, creates structure and affects function.  Yet, reliable prediction of this important base pairing information remains an open problem in computational molecular biology.  RNA folding prediction is typically approached as a discrete optimization under a thermodynamic objective function.   When reformulated as a linear program, we can fully analyze all possible multiloop entropy parameters using techniques from geometric combinatorics.  In this way, we find new branching parameters which significantly increase prediction accuracy on well-defined families.  Moreover, these results also illuminate why the general problem is so difficult.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The simulation of reaction-diffusion processes in biology is a multiple scale problem. This problem is at the core of the grand challenge of whole cell simulation. One of the most common approaches to simulation at mesoscopic scales of reaction-diffusion processes is to summarise each molecule as a Brownian point in space and each reaction as the events that occur when these points are sufficiently close (like collisions of hard spheres). As with all simulation algorithms at this scale, there are limitations to this model. An important limitation is that it only describes bimolecular reactions. In this work, we show how to generalise this framework so that it incorporates complex high-order and catalytic reactions where multiple time scales are important.

    <EventDescription>The study of the synergetic effects of multiple interacting disturbances on the dynamical behavior of a biological system has received extensive attention.  However, the interactions among disturbances are highly complex and the impacts are still not well understood. In this talk, we present a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations to study the effects of exogenous pressures on the dynamics of tree ecosystems. Specifically, it incorporates the effects of non-lethal harvesting and habitat reduction. The resulting model allows the derivation of a general formula to determine the rational non-lethal harvesting level and habitat size to ensure the sustainability of the plant ecosystem. The model will be applied to fruit harvesting of pentadesma trees under different habitat sizes.

    <EventDescription>Traditional drug design takes 2.6 billion dollars and 10-15 years to put an average new drug on the market. ML/DL and computational chemistry show a great potential to revolutionize drug discovery. My series of innovative ML/DL and computational chemistry models form a whole workflow of in silico drug discovery from lead generation, potency prediction, ADMET, and side-effect screening to binding simulations, which can largely replace traditional lab tests. These models outperform the published state-of-the-art methods in numerous standard benchmarks. More importantly, our models are the largest winner in D3R Grand Challenges (Drug Design Data Resource Blinded Community Prediction Challenges).

    <EventDescription>Size modified Poisson-Boltzmann (SMPB) equations have been studied for more than thirty years. However, how to efficiently solve a nonuniform SMPB ion channel (nuSMPBIC) model remains a difficult research topic. In fact, a nuSMPBIC model is a complex nonlinear system that mixes $n$ nonlinear algebraic equations with one Poisson boundary value problem when a solution contains $n$ ionic species. It also involves two physical domains --- a simulation box domain for potential functions and a solvent domain for ionic concentration functions, not to mention its strong singularities and nonlinearities. In this talk, I will present a new finite element iterative scheme for solving a nuSMPBIC model. The novelty of this scheme lays on a damped two-block iterative method and a modified Newton iterative scheme for solving each related nonlinear algebraic system. This scheme has been implemented as a program package for an ion channel protein with a three-dimensional molecular structure and a solution of $n$ ionic species with distinct ion sizes. Numerical results for a voltage-dependent anion channel in a mixture of four ionic species will be reported in this talk to demonstrate a fast convergence rate of the damped two-block iterative method, the high performance of the software package, and the importance of considering nonuniform ion sizes. This work was partially supported by the Simons Foundation, USA, through research award 711776.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In Stokes flow, Purcell's scallop theorem forbids objects with time-reversible (reciprocal) swimming strokes from moving. In the presence of inertia, this restriction is eased and reciprocally deforming bodies can swim. Recent work has investigated an asymmetric spherical dimer of oscillating length as a simple model swimmer. Analytical, numerical, and experimental studies have shown a dense (i.e. inertial) dimer swims in Stokes flow. Similarly, numerical study shows a dimer in fluid of intermediate Reynolds number (Re = 1-1000) swims in a direction that varies depending on the degree of fluid inertia. Here, we introduce a general model for the inertial flow produced by an oscillating dimer at small amplitudes. We apply the finite element method, using the PETSc library to solve a coupled pair of linear PDEs, to probe the dimer's swim speed with respect to the degree of fluid or solid inertia. The results are compared to asymptotic solutions obtained via the method of reflections. We find the model's predictions match those of the dense Stokes swimmers in the appropriate limit, and that the behavior in inertial fluid is consistent with previous numerical analysis.

    <EventDescription>Advances in single-cell technologies allow scrutinizing of heterogeneous cell states, however, detecting cell-state transitions from snap-shot single-cell transcriptome data remains challenging. To investigate cells with transient properties or mixed identities, we present MuTrans, a method based on multiscale reduction technique to identify the underlying stochastic dynamics that prescribes cell-fate transitions. By iteratively unifying transition dynamics across multiple scales, MuTrans constructs the cell-fate dynamical manifold that depicts progression of cell-state transitions, and distinguishes stable and transition cells. In addition, MuTrans quantifies the likelihood of all possible transition trajectories between cell states using coarse-grained transition path theory. Downstream analysis identifies distinct genes that mark the transient states or drive the transitions. The method is consistent with the well-established Langevin equation and transition rate theory. Applying MuTrans to datasets collected from different single-cell experimental platforms, we show its capability and scalability to robustly unravel complex cell fate dynamics induced by transition cells in systems such as tumor EMT, iPSC differentiation and blood cell differentiation. Overall, our method bridges data-driven and model-based approaches on cell-fate transitions at single-cell resolution.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Reactive hypoglycemia (RH) occurs when blood glucose falls below basal levels following consumption of high-sugar foods, and it can present as postprandial episodes of excess sweating, nausea, and dizziness. RH triggers a counterregulatory response that attempts to restore glucose concentrations to normoglycemic levels and represents a distinct metabolic state involving increased hepatic glucose release, increased lipolysis, and decreased peripheral glucose utilization. Standard minimal models of metabolite (e.g., glucose, insulin, glycerol, and free fatty acids) dynamics may not accurately describe the dynamics of metabolites under both standard and RH conditions. Furthermore, RH may complicate interpretation of model parameters since a single parameter is estimated from data collected under two distinct metabolic states. To model the counterregulatory response in glycerol dynamics, we developed a function to describe glycerol production due to lipolysis that allows maximum lipolysis rates to increase above basal fasted lipolysis rates in the presence of RH. We applied this model to glycerol and insulin data from adolescent girls with obesity experiencing RH during an oral glucose tolerance test. This modeling approach allows more robust representation of glycerol and insulin data occurring in individuals with RH.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In today's interconnected world, it is of paramount importance to take transport processes induced by human mobility into account when considering the spreading of an epidemic. The global airline or the local public transport network alike provide room for people to meet in oftentimes small and poorly ventilated spaces, facilitating the spreading of a contagion. Importantly, these transient encounters are not restricted to each individual's immediate social environment. In this talk, we will introduce a network model of epidemic dynamics in a population in the presence of a transport process. We will discuss the derivation of the corresponding mean-field equations and quantify the influence of the transport process on the epidemic threshold.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be quite variable depending on the network of interaction adapting in the communities. In this regard, the data from Nepal provides a unique opportunity to get insights into COVID-19 transmission because of the existing complex interaction network within Nepalese communities due to the open-border of some communities with India, one of the most COVID-19 impacted countries in the world, and heterogeneity in contact patterns among communities. In this talk, I will present data-driven models to describe COVID-19 transmission through Interactions within Communities of Nepal. I will demonstrate how our models can provide vital information for developing control strategies and vaccination programs to manage healthcare facilities in Nepal.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>An overlooked effect of ecosystem eutrophication is the potential to alter disease dynamics in primary producers, inducing disease-mediated feedbacks that alter net primary productivity and elemental recycling. Models in disease ecology rarely track organisms past death, yet death from infection can alter important ecosystem processes including elemental recycling rates and nutrient supply to living hosts. In contrast, models in ecosystem ecology rarely track disease dynamics, yet elemental nutrient pools (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus) can regulate important disease processes including pathogen reproduction and transmission. Thus, both disease and ecosystem ecology stand to grow as fields by exploring questions that arise at their intersection. However, we currently lack a framework explicitly linking these disciplines. We developed a stoichiometric model using elemental currencies to track primary producer biomass (carbon) in vegetation and soil pools, and to track prevalence and the basic reproduction number (R0) of a directly transmitted pathogen. This model, parameterized for a deciduous forest, demonstrates that anthropogenic nutrient supply can interact with disease to qualitatively alter both ecosystem and disease dynamics. Using this element-focused approach, we identify knowledge gaps and generate predictions about the impact of anthropogenic nutrient supply rates on infectious disease and feedbacks to ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The rate at which COVID-19 spread through South Africa varied over time as individuals responded to the ongoing pandemic and changing government policies. In this project we model the outbreak in the province of Gauteng assuming that several parameters vary over time. We first determine the approximate dates of parameter changes and relate them to government policies. Unknown parameters are then estimated from available data and used to analyze the impact of each policy. We conclude by considering the implementation of two different vaccines at varying times. Our results quantify the impact of different government policies and demonstrate how vaccinations can alter infection dynamics.

    <EventDescription>Zika is a virus which is generally mild in expression. However, many cases of severe birth defects from pregnant women infected with Zika have occurred. The virus is primarily spread by mosquitoes, and control of mosquitoes can help decrease the spread of Zika and other pathogens. The success of many control measures is highly dependent upon ecological, physiological, and life history traits of mosquito species. One trait of interest is mosquito body mass, which depends upon many factors associated with the environment in which juvenile mosquitoes develop. Our experiments examined the impact of larval density on the body mass of \textit{Aedes aegypti} mosquitoes, which are important vectors of Zika. To investigate the interactions between the larval environment and mosquito body mass, we built a discrete time mathematical model that incorporates body mass, larval density, and food availability and fit the model to our experimental data. From the larval model, we build an adult model that considers gonotrophic cycle stages as well as disease spread with a simple SEIR model for humans. The dynamics are not straight forward as some traits of large mosquitoes increase the likelihood of Zika epidemic, while others diminish transmission. We consider how mosquito body mass affects a potential Zika outbreak using our mathematical model.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Following injury, skin activates a complex wound healing program. While cellular and signaling mechanisms of wound repair have been extensively studied, the principles of epidermal-dermal interactions and their effects on wound healing outcomes are only partially understood. We developed a multiscale, hybrid mathematical model of skin wound healing. The model takes into consideration interactions between epidermis and dermis across the basement membrane via diffusible signals, defined as activator and inhibitor. Simulations revealed that epidermal-dermal interactions are critical for proper extracellular matrix deposition in the dermis, suggesting these signals may influence how wound scars form. Our model predicts the important role of signaling across dermal-epidermal interface and the effect of fibrin clot density and wound geometry on scar formation. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>From synchronized neurons to locust swarms, collective behaviors abound anywhere in nature that objects or agents interact. Investigators modeling collective behavior face a variety of challenges involving data from simulation and/or experiment. We present projects that use topological data analysis (TDA) to address two challenges, namely model selection and detection of dynamical of transitions, both in the context of collective behavior of insects. In the first project, we study motion tracking data from laboratory experiments on pea aphids and use TDA for model selection, determining whether the aphids' behavior is better described by a model that incorporates social interactions or by a control model that does not. In the second project, we study dynamical transitions related to a eusocial behavior in honeybees: food exchange, also known as trophallaxis. When applied to our experimental data, TDA detects distinct temporal regimes, namely, pre- and post- food distribution phases, separated by a food-exchange phase during which clusters of bees form. In both projects, the key approach is to characterize a system's dynamics via the time-evolution of topological invariants called Betti numbers, accounting for persistence of topological features across multiple scales.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Inferring the structure and dynamical interactions of complex biological systems is critical to understanding and controlling their behavior. I am interested in discovering models, assuming I have time-series data of important state variables and knowledge of the possible types of interactions between state variables. The problem is then selecting which interactions, or model terms, are most likely responsible for the observed dynamics. Several challenges make model selection difficult including nonlinearities, varying parameters or equations, and unmeasured state variables. I will describe methods for reframing these problems so that sparse model selection is possible including sparsity-constrained variational annealing and methods to improve data informativity. I will discuss differences between methods designed for chaotic systems and those with non-chaotic attracting fixed points, as well as robustness issues.

    <EventDescription>Shifts in attention are associated with changes in spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity in neural populations throughout the brain, including extrastriate visual and prefrontal areas. Although these neurophysiological attention correlates are dynamic, the computational roles of the dynamics themselves have been seldom studied. We recorded neural populations in visual and prefrontal cortical areas of monkeys performing spatial selective attention tasks, and analyzed the dynamics of attention signals at the level of individual neurons and of neural populations. First, we found that attention signals in sensory cortex were dynamic on faster timescales than attention signals in frontal cortex. This may indicate a division of labor across brain areas for computations that rely on different dynamic regimes. Second, we found that the time-course of attention effects was highly heterogenous across visual neurons, and this variation was related to other functional properties of neurons, such as whether they were inhibitory/excitatory, or the strength of their functional coupling to the broader population. This provides important clues about the circuit organization of dynamic attention processes. Third, we found that the strength of dynamic stability on a moment-by-moment basis was related to attentional lapses evident in behavior. Taken together, these findings advance our understanding of attention mechanisms in the context of the dynamic brain.

    <EventDescription>Inhibitory neurons play a crucial role in many components of sensory processing, including modulating feature selectivity, mediating response suppression, and maintaining an asynchronous network state. Past mathematical models have successfully replicated and furthered our understanding of some of these processes by considering a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. However, experimental evidence has shown that significant diversity exists within this inhibitory population, with 80\% of neurons falling into one of three major subtypes: parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SOM)-, and vasointestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing neurons. 

In this talk, I will construct spatial models of the visual and auditory cortices that incorporate this diversity and make use of tools such as linear response theory to investigate the connectivity properties of these circuits. I will use these models and techniques to show how a division of labor among these interneuron subtypes enables the cortex to 1) have neurons selectively respond to directional auditory sweeps and 2) control gamma band synchronization during the presentation of visual stimuli.

    <EventDescription>Beta cells within the pancreatic islet coordinate their secretion of insulin during elevated glucose levels.  Electrical coupling between beta cells gives rise to a syncytium reminiscent of cardiac tissue.  Recent experimental work has suggested that a small population of hub cells, defined by correlated functional connectivity of calcium traces, and further identified to have higher glucokinase activity, are important for islet coordination.  In particular, silencing hub cells was able to greatly reduce the islet activity, leading to the hypothesis that a small set of pacemaker cells drive islet activity.  Historically, theory and modeling studies have favored a more democratic interpretation of islet activity where there may be leader cells initiating activity but loss of any one cell at most delays the inevitable bursting activity.  In this case the response curve to glucose has been shown both in experiment and in models to be sharpened by electrical coupling (ie. more cells must reach threshold to initiate activity, but then, across this threshold, more cells are recruited to  activity as compared to uncoupled cells).  In this talk we review some of the arguments against the likelihood that islets are governed by a cardiac-like pacemaker.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Vesicles are multiphase fluid systems where a lipid bilayer separates the two fluids. They form model systems for more complicated biological cells and have been proposed for various biotechnologies such as drug delivery systems. Due to the complex nature of the membrane, an understanding of how the properties of said membrane is crucial to advancing the use of vesicles in modern technologies. One less investigated property of these membranes is the ability to slide past each other due to the layers being weakly coupled. From a macroscopic point-of-view, this appears as a jump in the tangential velocity of the surrounding fluid, with the magnitude of this discontinuity depending on membrane properties. Building upon prior works in modeling vesicles with fully coupled membranes, a numerical model is presented capable of modeling vesicles with interfacial slip in general flows. After a brief discussion of the numerical methods involved, including the composition of computational stencils, the model will then be used to explore the dynamics of vesicles in various types of flows as a function of the membrane slip coefficient.

    <EventDescription>With the increasing practice of using biological data to assess and parameterize theoretical models, it is important to understand the conditions under which we can reliably recover model parameters from available data. This is particularly important in the context of epidemiological data, which may gradually become available alongside an emerging infection or may only be reported over large time intervals. In this work, we consider an SEIR infection model, with three unknown parameters. Our goal is to assess how different methods and resolutions of data collection determine parameter identifiability. We consider the impact of the frequency and duration of observations, for different types of observed data (infections, incidence, and cumulative incidence). We utilize both Monte Carlo simulations and correlation matrices to assess parameter identifiability under these conditions. We additionally present preliminary work connecting parameter identifiability to model specification, in the context of nested models.

    <EventDescription>The replicator equation, evolutionary game theory, Markov processes and chemical reaction networks all describe the dynamics of a population or probability distribution.  Sometimes the distribution approaches an equilibrium with the passage of time.  Relative entropy provides a quantitative measure of how far from equilibrium a system is, and various results give conditions under which relative entropy is non-increasing.  But even when a system does not approach equilibrium, we can often show the rate at which information is updated through natural selection equals the variance in fitness.  This is a new twist on Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The study of motifs can help researchers uncover links between the structure and function of networks in biology, sociology, economics, and many other areas. Empirical studies of networks have identified feedback loops, feedforward loops, and several other small structures as “motifs” that occur frequently in real-world networks and may contribute by various mechanisms to important functions in these systems. However, these mechanisms are unknown for many of these motifs. In previous work, we have demonstrated that one can identify function-relevant process motifs (i.e., structured sets of walks) in a network, and that these process motifs can improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying emergent properties of dynamics on networks. In the current work, we study the relationship between network structure and synchronization in neuronal networks. Using coherence as a measure of synchrony, we identify the contributions of process motifs to synchrony, and we investigate how changes in a network's structure can affect these process-motif contributions and synchrony.

    <EventDescription>Over the recent years, high-speed multi-cellular recordings from beta-cell networks within pancreatic islets has allowed for the study of diffusive coupling and coordination in heterogeneous networks of order 103 bursting cells. To this end, we have developed a mathematical model for studying the effects of spatial distribution of excitability on the global dynamics of a diffusively-coupled network embedded in a three-dimensional space. In this work, we focus on two subpopulations of oscillators, one intrinsically-active and the other inactive. I will first discuss the development of measures for spatial sortedness as well as procedures to iteratively adapt this sortedness in the network.  I will then discuss the implications of the resulting spatial non-uniformity on propensity of the network to exhibit globally coordinated oscillations. The goal of this work is to better understand how heterogeneity across several dimensions (coupling, excitability, and spatial distribution) can influence dynamic coordination in diffusively coupled oscillator networks. In the future, we will use this framework to study other networks structures, for example directed networks, networks with excitatory and inhibitory links, and networks with heterogeneous structural connectivity (e.g. scale-free networks).

    <EventDescription>Cells transmit different levels of traction in response to the ECM stiffness, which is critical to induce different levels of signaling. One of the frequent destinations of signaling is non-muscle myosin II, which generates contractile force within F-actin cytoskeleton. To explain differential traction, a molecular clutch model, where dynamic clutches between myosin-based F-actin retrograde flow and adhesions result in the force transmission to the ECM, had been developed. However, as myosin II is both the cause and the result of mechanotransduction, myosin alone might not explain the initial difference in force transmission. In this study, using high-resolution traction microscopy and myosin inhibitor, we show that differential force transmission in response to stiffness is myosin-independent. Inhibiting either of two actin nucleators, Arp2/3 and formin, in addition to myosin abrogated the increasing trend and induced biphasic force-stiffness trend by lowering the traction in high stiffness regime. We developed an actin polymerization-powered molecular clutch model where actin flows not only by myosin contractility but by actin polymerization. The model suggests that Arp2/3 inhibition should make adhesions slip more easily. Together, our data suggest that initial ECM stiffness sensing event by FAs is regulated by actin polymerization-based retrograde flow, synergistically mediated by Arp2/3 and formin.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>General anesthesia is characterized by changes in the EEG, primarily quantified using spectral analysis techniques, such as the spectrogram. EEG spectra display not only peaks that are indicative of the presence of neural rhythms, but also an overall trend of asynchronous activity that decays with frequency. Although EEG correlates of loss of consciousness (LOC) due to anesthetics such as propofol are often ascribed to changes in neural synchrony, mounting evidence suggests that some changes result from asynchronous neural activity. We have recently investigated how propofol alters the broadband (0.5-100 Hz) asynchronous properties of the EEG, and examined what implications this may have for interpreting changes in neural rhythms during LOC. We combined analysis of EEG recordings of humans undergoing propofol administration with biophysical modelling to decompose changes in the EEG during LOC into synchronous and asynchronous sources. Our results revealed that IPSP decay rate and mean spike rate shape asynchronous EEG features, that propofol’s effects on these parameters largely explain the changes in EEG spectra during LOC, and that traditional spectral EEG analysis likely conflates these effects with changes in rhythmic activity. We concluded that the propofol-induced alpha rhythm appears before LOC, and that the moment of LOC is uniquely correlated with the sudden appearance of a delta rhythm. I will provide a summary of these results in my talk.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>We use statistical mechanics techniques to obtain population density equations for large sparse neural networks. The connectivity is that of 'balanced excitation and inhibition', meaning that the sum of the magnitudes of all typical inputs into any one neuron typically diverges
with the system size, however the level of excitation typically balances the level of inhibition, thereby preventing the system from blowing up. The density of connection decays with distance, and in taking the large size limit one obtains a spatially-distributed neural-field equation. We finished by proving the existence of `bump attractors' of locally-excited neural activity.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Mitotic spindle is a remarkable molecular machine segregating chromosomes prior to cell division. The spindle self-assembles from centrosomes, microtubules and chromosomes very rapidly and accurately, so that in the end all chromosomes are bioriented (each chromosome is attached to the opposite spindle poles). For decades, the so-called search-and-capture model of this self-assembly was dominant. This model posited that the microtubules randomly probe the cell space until, by chance, all chromosomes connect to the microtubules. Recent data indicate that most chromosomes achieve biorientation at the same time in the same place, putting this model in doubt. I will show that both the data and stochastic computational model argue that a much more deterministic process of polarity sorting in a complex microtubule-motor system results from the rapid stochastic process and accounts for the rapid and accurate assembly of the spindle. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In this talk, we introduce a mathematical model to discuss the
interactions of combined therapy of oncolytic viruses and a
checkpoint inhibitor, anti-CTLA-4. The model incorporates both the
susceptible and infected tumor populations, virus population,
tumor-specific immune populations, virus-specific immune
populations, tumor suppressive cytokine IFN-$\gamma$, and the
effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor CTLA-4. Specially, we
distinct the tumor-specific immune abilities of  CD8$^+$ T and
CD4$^+$ T cells and describe the destructive ability of cytokine
on tumor cells as well as the inhibitory capacity of CTLA-4 on
various components. Our model confirms that the combined therapy
is more effective than OVT alone. We also investigate various
dosing strategies to provide effective therapies on improving
treatment outcomes. Our study reveals that the  tumor killing rate
by immune cells plays an important role in both the OVT
monotherapy and the joint therapy. Moreover, parameters related to
CD8$^+$ T cells have a large impact on treatment outcome with OVT
alone whereas parameters associated with IFN-$\gamma$ strongly
influence treatment response for the combined therapy. This study
indicates that it is the activation of host anti-tumor immune
system responses rather than its direct destruction of the tumor
cells play a major biological function of the combined therapy.

    <EventDescription>While the vast majority of humans are able to entrain their circadian rhythm to the 24-hour light-dark cycle, there are numerous individuals who are not able to do so due to disease or societal reasons. In this talk, we will use computational and mathematical methods to analyze a well-established model of human circadian rhythms to address cases where individuals do not entrain to the 24-hour light-dark cycle, leading to misalignment of their circadian phase. For each case, we provide a mathematically justified strategy for how to minimize circadian misalignment. In the case of non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, we show why appropriately timed bright light therapy induces entrainment. With regard to shift work, we explain why reentrainment times following transitions between day and night shifts are asymmetric, and how higher light intensity enables unusually rapid reentrainment after certain transitions. Finally, with regard to teenagers who engage in compensatory catch-up sleep on weekends, we propose a rule of thumb for sleep and wake onset times that minimizes circadian misalignment due to this type of social jet lag. In all cases, the primary mathematical approach involves understanding the dynamics of entrainment maps that measure the phase of the entrained rhythm with respect to the daily onset of lights.

    <EventDescription>Previous computational models of brain capillary networks have predicted that heterogeneous cerebral capillary flow patterns result in lower brain tissue partial oxygen pressures. However, these models have often considered simple capillary networks in terms of their geometric properties. Here, we describe computational models of brain capillary networks that have been used to determine how perturbations of network properties impact tissue oxygen levels. The models include variabilities in both their geometric (segment lengths and diameters) and three-dimensional, topological structure. The main result is that for a general class of networks, random perturbations of either segment diameters or conductances will always, on average, decrease the average tissue oxygen levels. This result is supported through both simulations of the models and mathematical analysis.

    <EventDescription>The surge of COVID-19 infections has been fueled by new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The molecular mechanism underlying such surge is elusive due to the existence of more than 4500 non-degenerate mutations on the S protein. Understanding the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and evolution is a prerequisite to foresee the trend of emerging vaccine-breakthrough variants and the design of mutation-proof vaccines and mABs. We integrate the genotyping of more than 3.3 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a library of 185 human antibodies, tens of thousands of mutational data, topological data analysis, and deep learning to reveal SARS-CoV-2 evolution mechanism and forecast emerging vaccine-breakthrough and antibody-resistant variants.
    
We demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough and antibody-resistant mutations are the primary mechanism of viral evolution.  We show that infectivity-strengthening and antibody-disruptive co-mutations on the S RBD can quantitatively explain the infectivity and virulence of all prevailing variants. We analyze emerging vaccine-breakthrough co-mutations in highly vaccinated countries and identify sets of co-mutations that have a high likelihood of massive growth. In addition, we found a antibody-resistant mutation Y449S has reduced infectivity compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Phase transition and pattern formation are common phenomena on biological membranes. They can be modeled by nonlinear reaction diffusion systems defined on (evolving) surfaces. In this talk, we would like to present some numerical method to solve such problems. The method is based on an Eulerian framework and can easily dual with the evolving surfaces. Numerical examples show that both the phase transition and Turing patterns can be simulated well by this method. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapy for multiple cancers, but to date only a minority of patients have been reported to receive clinical benefit from immunotherapy. This is, in part, because biomarkers for prediction of immunotherapy efficacy remain outstanding, and thus clinicians lack the information needed to identify the optimal treatment strategy for each patient early in the treatment process. To address this challenge, we have developed a mechanistic mathematical model of cancer immunotherapy made up of a set of mathematical biomarkers (MBs) that accurately predicts tumor response and survival following immunotherapy as a function of physical and biological changes reflecting immune responses. Each MB is a model-derived parameter with functional relationships that link it to a set of clinically measurable surrogates. Using only tumor imaging data already collected as standard-of-care from 124 patients, we found that the MBs were able to sort patient response with accuracy across all cancer-drug combinations examined. We then validated the MBs with data from 177 additional patients that received either anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1/PDL1 monotherapies. These results outperform the biomarkers used in current clinical practice in terms of prediction accuracy. This indicates that this readily-translatable predictive tool for personalized oncology may be broadly applicable to many additional cancer and immunotherapy combinations.

    <EventDescription>With progressing global warming, there is an increased risk that one or several climate tipping elements might cross a critical threshold, resulting in severe consequences for the global climate, for ecosystems and for human societies. However, it is known that the different climate components cannot be viewed as individual entities, but they interact across scales in space and time.
 
Therefore, we assess the risk for the emergence of tipping cascades in two different interacting climate systems by using the recently developed python package “PyCascades”:
(i) We investigate the role of local forest adaptations in the Amazon rainforest with respect to potential cascading forest transitions in response to future droughts. (ii) We analyze tipping risks in a small subset of four interacting tipping elements (Greenland Ice Sheet, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Amazon rainforest) in response to temperature overshoots trajectories. In the latter example, we will also separate safe from unsafe overshoot scenarios

    <EventDescription>Shift workers experience profound circadian disruption due to the nature of their work, which often has them on-the-clock at times when their internal clock is sending a strong, sleep-promoting signal. Mathematical models can be used to generate recommendations for shift workers that move their internal clock state to better align with their work schedules, promote overall sleep, promote alertness at key times, or achieve other desired outcomes. Yet for these schedules to have a positive effect in the real world, they need to be acceptable to the shift workers themselves. In this talk, I will survey the types of schedules a shift worker may be recommended by an algorithm, and how they can collide with the preferences of the real people being asked to follow them, and how math can be used to arrive at new schedules that take these human factors into account.

    <EventDescription>Agent-based models (ABMs) have made great advances in the study of tumor development and therapeutic response, allowing researchers to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the tumor and its microenvironment. However, these models face serious drawbacks in the realm of parameterization – parameters are typically set individually based on various data and literature sources, rather than through a rigorous parameter estimation approach. While ABMs could be fit to time-course data, that type of data loses the spatial information that is a defining feature of ABMs. On the other hand, tumor images, while providing spatial information, represent only a single time-point, and it is exceedingly difficult to compare tumor images to ABM simulations beyond a qualitative visual comparison. Without a quantitative method of comparing the similarity of tumor images to ABM simulations, a rigorous parameter fitting is not possible. Here, we present a novel approach that provides a quantitative comparison of tumor images and ABM simulations. We compute the similarity between ABM predictions and tumor images as a set of spatially-resolved datapoints, preserving the spatial layout of cells. This allows us to then minimize the difference between the two using standard parameter-fitting algorithms.

    <EventDescription>The cellular nucleus is enclosed by a permeable membrane mechanically supported by a meshwork of lamin fibers.  The morphology and integrity of the nucleus are essential for the cell's function. Recent experiments show that loss of the lamin network results in nuclear deformations and rupture. To understand the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon, we developed a mathematical model that accounts for, and couples, the fluid flows around and through the permeable membrane, and the pulling on the membrane by membrane-bound, but mobile, molecular motors attached to impinging microtubules. Here the microtubules are assumed to nucleate from a cellular centrosome. We found that this model predicts the formation of a sharp corner in the vicinity of the centrosome, rather reminiscent of the Taylor cone for a surfactant-laden drop in an elongational flow.  We analyze the equilibrium shape of the membrane in terms of the total number of motors and their mobility in the nuclear membrane. Our model provides a more mechanistic understanding of nuclear deformation in cells and can give insights into the correspondence between motor forces and membrane deformation leading to nuclear rupture, which has been observed in some cancer cells.

    <EventDescription>Live cell imaging and single particle tracking techniques have become increasingly popular amongst the mathematical biology community. Lysosomes, known for endocytosis, phagocytic destruction, and autophagy, move about the cell along microtubules. Intracellular transport of lysosomes is carried out in membrane-bound vesicles through the use of motor proteins. Single particle tracking methods utilize stochastic models to simulate intracellular transport and give rise to rigorous analysis of the resulting properties, specifically related to transitioning between inactive to active states. We find confidence in our methodology and develop simulations to capture these properties at multiple frames rates. Determining an optimal frame rate for capturing live cell data is necessary in order to successfully infer properties or the underlying mechanisms. We rely on an optimal frame rate to extract properties about the microtubule network of the cell.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Ca$^{2+}$ elevations in the vicinity of open Ca$^{2+}$ channels (Ca$^{2+}$ "nanodomains") trigger secretory vesicle exocytosis and other fundamental cell processes. Ca$^{2+}$ nanodomains are shaped by the interplay between Ca$^{2+}$ diffusion and binding to intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ buffers, and can be estimated by approximating the stationary solution of the corresponding reaction-diffusion problem, in closed form. Such closed-form approximations help in the modeling of Ca$^{2+}$-dependent cell processes, without resorting to computationally expensive numerical simulations. However, previously developed approximants had been shown to represent asymptotic expansions restricted to specific regions of the relevant parameter space, and only apply the case case of buffers with a single Ca$^{2+}$ binding site, whereas most biological buffers have more complex Ca$^{2+}$-binding stoichiometry. Here we describe a new closed-form approximation method based on interpolation between the short-range Taylor series of the Ca$^{2+}$ or buffer concentration with the corresponding long-range asymptotic series expressed in inverse powers of distance from channel location. We show this this new method achieves reasonable accuracy for a wider range of buffering conditions, and can also be extended to the case of Ca$^{2+}$ buffers with two Ca$^{2+}$-binding sites.

    <EventDescription>Mathematical modeling of viral kinetics can be used to gain further insight into the viral replication cycle and virus-host interactions. However, many of the virus dynamics models do not incorporate the cell-to-cell heterogeneity of virus yield or the time-dependent factor of virus replication. A recent study of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) kinetics in single BHK cells determined that both virus production rate and yield of virus particles varies widely between individual cells of the same cell population. Here we use the results of the previously mentioned study to determine the distribution that best describes the time course of viral production within the single cells. We determined a list of eight potential distributions that are commonly used in viral kinetics models to fit to each data set by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. The model of best fit for each individual cell was determined using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICC ). Results of this study show that the distribution that best describes viral production varies from cell to cell. This finding could have further reaching implications for incorporating time-dependent viral production into a standard model of virus kinetics in order to better reproduce the diversity of viral replication that occurs over time within a population of cells. 	</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Blood coagulation is a network of biochemical reactions whereby dozens of proteins act collectively to initiate a rapid clotting response. Coagulation reactions are lipid-surface dependent, and this dependence is thought to help localize coagulation to the site of injury and enhance the association between reactants. Current models of coagulation fail to agree with laboratory studies under variations in lipid concentrations. Models overestimate conversion efficiencies of critical coagulation proteins and fail to capture spatial limitations of lipid surfaces. We developed a mathematical model of lipid-mediated enzyme reactions where the association rate between lipid-bound reactants is modified by an interaction probability (IP). The IP is derived by considering the fraction of the lipid surface that is occupied by any lipid-bound species, and accounts for surface crowding. We performed constrained optimization to estimate a set of intrinsic rates for the enzyme-substrate pair. Preliminary results agree with experiments and reveal a critical lipid concentration where the conversion rate of the coagulation protein is maximized, inferring that the model can describe the dilution effect where, as lipid is increased, proteins are physically separated, and reaction rates decrease. Further refinements of the model, including product inhibition due to experimental design, are also incorporated to better understand the impacts of the dilution effect in more complex reaction networks.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Understanding the basis of shared, across trial fluctuations in neural activity in mammalian cortex is critical to uncovering the nature of information processing in the brain. This correlated variability has often been related to the structure of cortical connectivity since variability not accounted for by signal changes likely arises from local circuit inputs. Recordings from segregated networks of (excitatory) pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex reveal that across-network noise correlations are larger than predicted given the weak cross-network connection probability. We aim to uncover the circuit mechanisms responsible for these enhanced correlations through biologically-motivated cortical network models. In particular, we use a Wilson-Cowan-type firing rate model with weakly connected subpopulations to study the impact of cross-population connection strength on cross-population interactions. Preliminary findings suggest that scaling excitatory connections scales correlations proportionally, but that inhibition may play a key role in shaping the enhanced correlations observed in the absence of strong excitatory-excitatory subnetwork connectivity. We are working to extend this rate-based approach to a more realistic spiking neuronal network with clustered excitatory subpopulations with weak cross-cluster connection probability.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cell migration is the movement of cells responding to chemical gradients acting as signals. It is integral to daily functions like development and healing; also, progress in studies can lead to findings in cancer metastasis. This research centers on movement of a cluster of migratory cells among nurse cells toward the oocyte in the egg chamber of Drosophila melanogaster. This organism has a well-studied history and many human homologs in genetics. We ask: How to model cell migration through force balances, and what changes to parameters, equations, and geometry are needed? 
To answer this, we capture heterogeneous cells of the egg chamber: including nurse, epithelial, and migratory border cells using interactions between cell membranes and arising via forces, including adhesive, repulsive, and spring forces. We use a volume force to include heterogeneously sized cells and realistic sizing. When cells fill the chamber, we enact the migratory force, which stems from a chemical gradient signaling, allowing border cells to climb through nurse cells. We solve the force balance equation with a Euler’s step to capture progression in time. In MATLAB, we code cell boundaries around cell centers to represent membranes while adapting parameters, equations, and coefficients in order to realistically simulate cell migration.

    <EventDescription>In response to a glucose challenge, the pancreas releases insulin which, under healthy conditions, 1) suppresses lipolysis in adipose tissue to decrease glycerol concentration, and 2) regulates glucose concentration through action in muscle and liver. Insulin resistance (IR) occurs when more insulin is required to achieve the same control, and IR may be tissue-specific. Adipose, liver, and muscle tissue exhibit distinct dose-dependent responses to insulin in multi-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic (HE) clamps, but the HE clamp protocol does not address potential differences in the dynamics of tissue-specific insulin responses. To investigate metabolic dynamics in adipose tissue, we developed a differential-equations based model that describes the coupled dynamics of glycerol and insulin action during an oral glucose tolerance test in female adolescents with obesity and IR. To quantify the metabolic dynamics in muscle and liver, the oral minimal model was applied to applied to glucose and insulin data collected under the same protocol. We found that the action of insulin on glycerol peaks earlier and more closely resembles the dynamics of plasma insulin compared to insulin action on glucose. These findings suggest that the dynamics of insulin action show tissue-specific differences in our IR population. Improved understanding of the tissue-specific dynamics of insulin action may provide novel insights into the progression of metabolic disease.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Interactions between individual agents drive the emergence of rich group dynamics across biological scales, with applications spanning intracellular transport, tissue formation and regeneration, disease spread, and insect swarms. In all of these applications, scientists are interested in uncovering normal agent behavior and predicting the changes to group-level properties that will emerge under altered interactions. This general goal is complicated by the fact that detailed models of complex systems can have many parameters; emergence is a stochastic and imperfect process; and data on complex systems is often qualitative or composed of many confounding factors. Motivated by these challenges, our session brings together researchers developing topological techniques, data-driven approaches for model selection and development, and mechanistic models to understand complex biological systems. Our goal is to highlight complementary approaches to the challenges in complex-systems research and lead to cross-fertilization between mathematical sub-fields.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Firing rate or neural mass models, and their spatially-dependent extensions neural field models, have been a successful mathematical reduction for the high-dimensional nonlinear systems representing neuronal networks and their activity. They have particularly enabled analytic investigation of network-based activity such as population oscillations and spatial propagation of neural activity. Original reduction formalisms relied on simplifying assumptions, such as generic neuron responses, homogeneous network connectivity and connection dynamics. For example, a key assumption is that firing rates increase with excitatory input following a sigmoidal response function. Recently, new formalisms have been introduced that account for diverse neuron response properties, more realistic network and synaptic properties as well as neural-based noise. This minisymposium focuses on the mathematical derivation of these new formalisms and mathematical analyses made possible by using firing rate models for brain networks.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Physiological systems constructed of individual nodes (cells) form networks (tissues).  Emergent properties from these networks are often the basis for normal behavior, and disruption of these properties from the cellular to the system level can lead to dysfunction and disease.  We (1) describe phenomena in the brain from neuroendocrine cells and their networks to the blood brain barrier and overarching brain rhythms, and (2) explore behaviors that can impact glucose modulation from individual calcium dynamics within cells to islet networks and system wide homeostasis.  The mini-symposium is held in honor of Arthur Sherman’s 70th Birthday. He is a pioneer in the modeling and analysis of systems like these.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Soft tissue organs are responsible for maintaining significant functions of human beings. These organs may also be involved with the fluid environment, and provide tubular or porous pathways for the body fluid to move. The organs can deform or grow under internal biomolecular simulations or external environmental changes. The soft organs can be normal parts of the body, or formed under later pathophysiological alterations. Normal soft organs can also become pathological to hinder their regular functions. Solid or fluid mechanics is usually used as a powerful tool to model the soft-organ deformation and growth under complicated solid-fluid interactions. In this minisymposium, we study two such organs, the blood vessels and cancerous tumors. For the blood vessels, we determine its stiffness parameters, study pharmacological substance treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension, and interpret intimal thickening for fibrous vessels induced by hemodynamical shear stresses. For the cancerous tumor, we exhibit why the tumor always grows to the surrounding porous region with low conductivity when the tumor morphology is steady.  The audience is welcome to interact with the speakers to learn related research advancement and seek potential collaborations.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cardiac arrhythmias are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality and are caused by various physiological or structural factors, ranging from changes in a single ion channel gene to tissue-scale phenomena. One of the most important goals of cardiac modeling is integrating disparate data into coherent models that can replicate and predict the effects of changes in the electrical conduction substrate at the large-scale cardiac tissue level. Such electrical models are crucial in understanding cardiac arrhythmias, as well as in testing and proposing new treatments that shift activity back to the physiological state. This minisymposium gathers researchers with specialties from across the disparate scales relevant for cardiac dynamics to consider the impact of modelling on the development, identification, and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Surface active agents (such as surfactants or lipids) are amphiphilic molecules with different affinity to solvents: hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails. These amphiphilic systemsare able to form supramolecular structures across many length scales from nanometer to micrometer to reduce unfavorable energetic interactions. Dynamics of lipid bilayer in vivo involves multiscale interactions with surrounding fluid and other macromolecular complexes. To date, grand challenges remain in high-fidelity modeling and efficient computation of the self-assembly process, specifically composition variations, large deformation and topological changes of membrane induced by multiscale electrostatic, entropic, hydrodynamics, and mechanical interactions. This minisymposium will (1) address some of the most interesting topics in modeling of bilayer membranes, including coupling of asymmetric bilayers, protein insertion and pore formation, pattern formation, multicomponent coupling, fluid-vesicle
coupling, fluid-electrostatics-vesicle coupling, and fast algorithms; (2) nurture collaborations among investigators in applied and computational mathematics, biophysics, and mechanical engineering.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Across settings ranging from molecular evolution to human social systems, the dynamics of competition and cooperation help to shape the world around us. Evolutionary game theory provides a flexible framework for exploring the ways in which traits and behaviors spread through populations via natural selection or social learning, allowing us to understand how interactions between individuals can promote emergent phenomena at the population level. In this session, we hope to bring together researchers using game-theoretic approaches to study scientific questions ranging from bacterial cooperation and the evolutionary dynamics of cancer to the establishment of cooperative social institutions and the sustainable management of common-pool resources. Mathematically, our speakers will draw upon analytical and computation techniques from stochastic processes, ordinary and partial differential equations, and network science to describe the long-time dynamics of both finite and infinite populations. A main goal for our session is to highlight recent theoretical and applied advances in evolutionary game theory, and to promote cross-fertilization of ideas for game-theoretic modeling arising from different mathematical approaches and from areas of application including ecology, oncology, economics, and sociology.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The beautiful red, pink, purple, and blue colors in plants are primarily due to plant pigments called anthocyanins.  Anthocyanins play crucial roles in plant ecology and cellular biology, participating in energy transduction pathways, acting as photoprotectants, and influencing pant-pollinator interactions.  They form complex patterns, and they undergo phase changes that are highly dependent on the complex in vivo cellular environment.  Speakers in this minisymposium apply mathematical models to understand anthocyanin biochemistry and the related ecology.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Oscillations are ubiquitous in biology, occurring at all scales and performing a plethora of functions.
Genes producing regulator proteins in response to oscillatory signals can be less susceptible to stochastic fluctuations than those responding to constant inputs.
Protein oscillations help establish and maintain circadian rhythms.
Multi-strain microbial consortia exhibit population-level oscillations when integrating chemical signals and environmental cues.

Such oscillatory phenomena are often finely tuned in terms of frequency and amplitude. 
When the characteristics of a biological oscillator deviate from normal operating ranges, the results can be catastrophic: Protein over-expression, sleep disorders, hormonal problems.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying biological oscillations is therefore of great importance.
Mathematical models can both capture and suggest such mechanisms. 

This minisymposium will feature talks describing models of biological oscillations at a multitude of scales.
The benefits of such oscillations will be discussed, as will the scientific challenges that lay ahead.
These challenges span many disciplines, from medicine and physiology to biochemistry and synthetic biology.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The formation of a blood clot is a complex biochemical and biophysical process that occurs on multiple spatial and temporal scales, and under various flow conditions. Significant bleeding or thrombosis, the pathological formation of a blood clot, can result from defects and perturbations in the clotting system. Due to the complexity of this system, the various responses and their underlying mechanisms are challenging to predict. Mathematical models of blood clot formation and coagulation can help interpret experimental data, elucidate unknown biochemical and biophysical mechanisms, and serve as predictive tools. In this minisymposium, speakers will present new computational and mathematical approaches used to understand the complexity of the clotting system.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Sickle cell disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the beta-globin chain which result in hemoglobin polymerization upon deoxygenation and subsequent red blood cell sickling. Sickling events trigger a cascade of downstream effects – including hemolysis, inflammation, and obstructions of small blood vessels – leading to ischemia, pain crisis, organ damage, and reduced life expectancy for sickle cell patients. In this minisymposium, we highlight a broad range of mathematical approaches that have been used to further understanding of different aspects of disease pathophysiology and to develop new treatment options for patients. Multi-scale models have been utilized to understand the regulation of red blood cell production, blood flow mechanics and rheology, and formation of vaso-occlusions. Statistical analysis and machine learning have also been employed to investigate frequency of pain-crises and mechanisms promoting disease progression in sickle cell patients. Speakers for the minisymposium are selected from academia and industry to foster discussions and potential future collaborations. Another aim for this minisymposium is to increase awareness of sickle cell disease burden and to invite the SIAM Life Sciences community to contribute to the development of new mathematical models and techniques that can ultimately improve quality of life outlook for sickle cell patients.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Biological processes are incredibly complex, ranging a plethora of spatial and temporal scales and depending sensitively on the interactions of their constitutive parts.  For instance, a neuron's regulation of axonal length depends on unimpeded transport of molecular motors. In a synthetic biology lab, diffusive communication between bacterial cells in a growing colony leads to shifting spatiotemporal patterns in response to externally supplied morphogen. The emergence of a pandemic depends on a complex network of individuals who interact improperly. In each case the behavior of a macroscopic structure is influenced by microscopic interactions and vice versa. 

Mathematical models have a longstanding tradition of furthering understanding of such complex biological processes. Models are flexible and capture dynamics at a multitude of scales, be simple enough to focus on big picture dynamics, or unveil how the landscape of a particular species in an environment changes. Even reductionist models have provided valuable insights regarding underlying mechanisms of complex biological processes. However, to understand a complex system, more sophisticated models are required.

This minisymposium will feature talks describing models of a variety of biological processes at a multitude of scales.  The insights provided by these models will be discussed as well as the challenges in relating them to less mathematically inclined experimentalists to apply such insights in practice.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cardiac cell models have proliferated from early simple descriptions to various species- and cell-specific models, covering a number of experimental and clinical situations. Moreover, models now include disease-specific cases (such as heart failure or channel mutations) and sub-cellular processes, especially relating to intracellular calcium dynamics. These specialized models are key in describing the pathologies of the heart. Their development requires integrating structural and functional cell data, as well as taking into account biological variability. This minisymposium gathers researchers from theoretical, data-driven, and experimental fields to consider specialized cardiac modeling and the transfer of cardiac modeling results to the growing field of personalized medicine.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Many biological systems in neurophysiology, immunology and cellular biology exhibit rhythmic activities that can occur over multiple time scales ranging from slow to fast. The underlying  dynamics of the mathematical models describing these biological systems are quite complex and require the use of slow-fast analysis as a method to decipher their behaviour. While this method is quite powerful in determining how the interaction of times scales regulate rhythmicity in these systems, it has to be adapted closely to the specifics of the models under consideration. In this minisymposium, we will explore the applications of slow-fast analysis to investigate the dynamics of several biological systems and how it is adapted to the models used.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The global pandemic has put a spotlight on epidemiological research and the value of mathematical models to predict the time course of the disease dynamics in the presence of vaccines, treatments, and behavior adaptation such as social distancing. These special sessions feature researchers in epidemiology working on a wide variety of diseases such as HIV, COVID-19, Cancer, and Malaria.  The types of models considered span ODE models, PDE models, and integral equations and use a variety of techniques from statistics, data-fitting, and epi-genetics.  These special sessions provide a broad sampling of current work in mathematical epidemiology that help shed light on the underlying biological processes
and highlight the importance of predictive mathematical modeling as a foundation for policy decisions.  Speakers span from early career graduate students, postdoctoral fellows to faculty with established research programs.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Across settings ranging from molecular evolution to human social systems, the dynamics of competition and cooperation help to shape the world around us. Evolutionary game theory provides a flexible framework for exploring the ways in which traits and behaviors spread through populations via natural selection or social learning, allowing us to understand how interactions between individuals can promote emergent phenomena at the population level. In this session, we hope to bring together researchers using game-theoretic approaches to study scientific questions ranging from bacterial cooperation and the evolutionary dynamics of cancer to the establishment of cooperative social institutions and the sustainable management of common-pool resources. Mathematically, our speakers will draw upon analytical and computation techniques from stochastic processes, ordinary and partial differential equations, and network science to describe the long-time dynamics of both finite and infinite populations. A main goal for our session is to highlight recent theoretical and applied advances in evolutionary game theory, and to promote cross-fertilization of ideas for game-theoretic modeling arising from different mathematical approaches and from areas of application including ecology, oncology, economics, and sociology.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Bacterial chemotaxis has been widely and extensively studied through experimental insights into the behavior of bacteria on the individual and population scale, coupled with mathematical models. This minisymposium brings together mathematicians and experimentalists working on the chemotactic behavior of bacteria at various scales. In one part, we will explore how an individual cell responds to change in their environment and suggest mathematical models or physical principles, guided by the recent experimental findings of bacterial chemotaxis on the individual cell scale. In the other part, we will consider applying mathematical modeling to understand the behavior of bacterial populations, a range from a classical Keller-Segel model to the multiscale modeling of the bacterial population.
The minisymposium is expected to foster collaborations among participants and is expected to enable the translation of theoretical research to experiments and subsequently to practice.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The rapid development of medical imaging and computing powers enables scientists to better understand and explore the biological systems from the atomic, molecular, and cellular levels. For complex biological systems involving different time and spatial scales, multiscale modeling is extremely useful to track down the interested details and obtain necessary large pictures concurrently.  Meanwhile simulating the systems at multiscale within feasible time and memory calls for the development of theoretical and numerical algorithms. This minisymposium aims to serve as a platform for promoting interdisciplinary research by bringing together experts from different areas involved in modeling, methodology, and applications of multiscale complex systems.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The transport of ions through pore channel proteins in cell membranes is a fundamental process in molecular biosciences. Modeling and simulation of ion channel transport has been carried out for a long time, but there are still many important open questions, for example the gating mechanism of certain ion channels is still obscure. While x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy has succeeded in determining the 3D structure of ion channels to high accuracy, the dynamic conformation changes that occur as ions pass through a channel are almost impossible to resolve by experiment. There is great interest in utilizing mathematical modeling and computer simulations to complement experiments and address the open questions surrounding ion channel transport.  Widely-used approaches are based on the (1) Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, (2) Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system, and (3) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Among these, MD is the most physically accurate, but it is computationally expensive, and  although the PB and PNP approaches provide less physical detail, they are more efficient and can more easily incorporate the boundary and interface conditions in physical systems. In this minisymposium, the presenters will report their current research on modeling and computation of ion channel transport in cell membranes. The scope will include computational and theoretical analysis of the most commonly used models and their recent implementation.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The formation of a blood clot is a complex biochemical and biophysical process that occurs on multiple spatial and temporal scales, and under various flow conditions. Significant bleeding or thrombosis, the pathological formation of a blood clot, can result from defects and perturbations in the clotting system. Due to the complexity of this system, the various responses and their underlying mechanisms are challenging to predict. Mathematical models of blood clot formation and coagulation can help interpret experimental data, elucidate unknown biochemical and biophysical mechanisms, and serve as predictive tools. In this minisymposium, speakers will present new computational and mathematical approaches used to understand the complexity of the clotting system.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Dynamical models consisting of networks of neural masses commonly assume that the interactions between neural populations are via additive or diffusive coupling. When using the additive coupling, a population's activity is affected by the sum of the activities of neighbouring populations. In contrast, when using the diffusive coupling a neural population is affected by the sum of the differences between its activity and the activity of its neighbours. These two coupling functions have been used interchangeably for similar applications. In this study, we show that the choice of coupling can lead to strikingly different brain network dynamics. We focus on a phenomenological model of seizure transitions that has been used both with additive and diffusive coupling in the literature. We consider small networks with two and three nodes, as well as large random and scale-free networks with 64 nodes. We further assess resting-state functional networks inferred from magnetoencephalography (MEG) from people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and healthy controls. To characterize the seizure dynamics on these networks, we use the escape time, the brain network ictogenicity and the node ictogenicity, which are measures of the network's global and local ability to generate seizure activity.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>This talk will describe ongoing work that aims to create numerical methods for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) that integrate partitioned and immersed approaches to FSI. Like conventional partitioned methods for FSI, our approach uses separate governing equations for the fluid and structure that are coupled only along the fluid-structure interface. However, our fluid-solid coupling strategy is based on the immersed interface method, which allows us to avoid using body-conforming discretizations and simplifies models involving very large structural displacements and deformations. Further, numerical tests suggest that even a simple Dirichlet-Neumann coupling strategy yields a stable numerical method across a very broad range of mass density ratios, without needing subcycling or implicit coupling between the fluid and solid degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that further improvements in performance can be achieved through multirate time stepping that uses different step sizes for the fluid and structure variables. The talk will also present detailed benchmarking studies along with biomedical applications of this methodology, including to models of clot capturing in inferior vena cava filters.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Symmetry often seems visually apparent in real biological systems. However, these systems are rarely exactly invariant under the associated transformation. It can therefore be challenging to apply the mathematical definition of symmetry to biology in meaningful ways. We propose a flexible, entropy-based method for quantifying the asymmetry of approximate symmetries that requires very little user input. We demonstrate its usefulness in simulated and real biological systems, and explore dynamics of approximate symmetries on both developmental and evolutionary timescales.

    <EventDescription>Cell-cell communication governs cell fate and decision-making in biology, primarily in the form of biochemical signaling, Understanding what forms of cell-cell communication are present in health and consequently perturbed in disease is crucial to fully understanding the functionality of biological systems. The recent explosion of single-cell RNA-sequencing has led to the development of cell-cell communication inference methods from gene expression data, enabling new studies on cell-cell communication at unprecedented depth and breadth. These methods reveal possible, simultaneous networks of relationships between cell types that are mediated by cell signaling. In this talk, we present work that builds on cell-cell communication inference output by inferring possible causal relations between signals. That is, does the presence of one signaling interaction cause a subsequent interaction, leading to a flow of information? We show how cell-cell communication and single-cell RNA-sequencing data can be framed in the language of causality and thus draw from existing tools developed for causal structure learning. We present some preliminary results of our method that have been applied to synthetic data generated by PDE modeling and suitable single-cell datasets.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Immunotherapies don't work for most cancer patients; but when they do work, they can work extremely well. Because there are often other treatment options to choose from, it is important to figure out as early as possible if a patient will be a "responder" or a "non-responder". I will present a method based on tumor size data, a simple equation and, machine learning to provide an early prediction of who will or will not respond [González-García et al. (2021) CPT Pharmacometrics Syst. Pharmacol., 10: 230-240. https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12594].

    <EventDescription>The timing of human sleep is strongly modulated by the 24 h circadian rhythm and the homeostatic sleep drive, the need for sleep that depends on the history of prior awakening. The homeostatic time constants may vary with development or interindividual characteristics and have been identified as important parameters for generating the transition from polyphasic to monophasic sleep. Features of the mean firing rate of the neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central pacemaker in humans, may differ with age or seasonality. We employ a physiologically-based flip-flop sleep-wake model to study the bifurcation sequences governing the transitions from polyphasic to monophasic sleep patterns as we vary the homeostatic time constants and temporal profile of the SCN firing rate. In particular, we modulate the rate at which the SCN firing rate transitions from low to high levels of activity, as well as the duration of its peak activity. We reduce the dynamics of the sleep-wake model to a one-dimensional circle map that captures the circadian phase of sleep onsets on successive days. Analysis of the structure and bifurcations in the map reveals changes in the average number of sleep episodes per circadian day caused by the separate or combined effects of the circadian waveform and faster accumulation/dissipation of sleep pressure.

    <EventDescription>The aim of this work is to develop an integrated fluido-chemical framework able to simulate the complex flow fields and oxygen transport in patient-specific models of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The intraluminal thrombus plays a key chemo-mechanical role in the evolution of aneurysms, which is not fully understood. Therefore, we present a coupled fluid–porous structure–oxygen transport computational model that provides insight into the salient behavior of thrombi under flow in compliant arteries, as well as the effects of thrombi on hemodynamics and arterial wall oxygen starvation, since local changes in tissue oxygenation and perfusion is a critical metric of its functional state. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations and Biot’s poroelasticity equations are used to model blood flow through the aorta and fluid-saturated thrombus respectively, while for oxygen transport due to the porous flow in the tissue, the convection-diffusion–reaction equation has been applied. Using this multiphysics model, we investigate how thrombus properties, such as permeability and compressibility, affect the risk of oxygen deprivation within the aneurysmal wall. Our results have shown that thrombi are associated with lower oxygen levels within the aortic tissue, which may cause arterial wall degeneration. We have also performed a systematic sensitivity study to assess the relationship between morphological features of the thrombus and the transport of oxygen to the aortic wall.

    <EventDescription> Mathematical modeling approaches to cell migration, such as ordinary or partial differential equations, require constant refinement, are laborious to develop, and are often inaccurate for single cells. On the other hand, machine learning approaches are quick, but may lack interpretability and the ability to predict. To validate mathematical models, large amounts of quantitative data are often required but are expensive to obtain. Here we present a novel machine learning algorithm to automatically hyper-accurately segment cells in microscopy images. The deep convolutional neural network mimics the human task of tracing objects in an image. Using these hyper-accurate cell segmentations, we investigate whether we can predict cell movement from cell morphology in chemotaxis assays.

    <EventDescription>Organoids are cell cultures that can be grown in a laboratory, mimicking certain functions of organ tissues in a mammalian body. By virtue of their similarity to mammalian organs, in terms of 3D tissue composition, organoids can be used to study organ development, disease progression and tissue responses to treatments in settings where 2D cell cultures fail to recapitulate what happens in vivo. It is known, for example, that both cancer and (successful) cancer treatment affect the subsequent development and composition of a tissue and, by extension, the shape of an organoid. In this talk, we present topological methods to study different data sets of videos of organoid experiments, including organoids derived from various organs of human and mouse GI tracts. We demonstrate how topological data analysis captures dynamic changes in the shape and size of these organoids. Based on these dynamic changes in shape and size over time, our analysis can discriminate between wild type and cancerous organoids and identify successful treatment effects.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>As sensory signals make their way from the sensory periphery to central neural circuits, they become mixed with complex ongoing cortical activity.  How do neural populations keep track of sensory information, separating signals from the noisy ongoing activity? Here we consider large neural populations simultaneously-recorded from primary sensory cortices and upstream sensory brain regions. We show that sensory signals are encoded more reliably and separated from noise in certain low-dimensional subspaces. We identified these coding subspaces based on correlations between cortex and upstream brain regions; the most correlated dimensions were best for decoding. Subspaces with approximately 5 dimensions were optimal for decoding although the neural populations we studied were much higher dimensional. We show that this principle generalizes across diverse sensory stimuli in the olfactory system and the visual system of awake mice. Our results suggest the cortex may multiplex different functions by executing them in different low dimensional subspaces.

    <EventDescription>The dynamics of an SIS epidemic patch model with asymmetric connectivity matrix is analyzed. It is shown that the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is strictly decreasing with respect to the dispersal rate of the infected individuals, and  the model has a unique endemic equilibrium if $R_0&gt;1$. The asymptotic profiles of the endemic equilibrium for small dispersal rates are characterized. In particular, it is shown that the endemic equilibrium converges to a limiting disease-free equilibrium as the dispersal rate of susceptible individuals tends to zero, and the limiting disease-free equilibrium has a positive number of susceptible individuals on each low-risk patch. Moreover a sufficient and necessary condition is found to  guarantee that the limiting disease-free equilibrium has no positive number of susceptible individuals on each high-risk patch. Our results extend earlier results for symmetric connectivity matrix, and we also partially solve an open problem by Allen et al. (SIAM J. Appl. Math., 67: 1283-1309, 2007)

    <EventDescription>Migrating cells, such as metastatic cancer cells, move in complex tissue environments. In this talk I will discuss work my group has done investigating how the velocity and shape of migrating cells is affected by the geometric and mechanical properties of the environment they are in. To capture some physical understanding, we develop simple theoretical models which we study using analytical calculations and numerical simulations. I will present our simple model of a cell as an active droplet and discuss our results on how the velocity, shape and ‘migration mode’ of this model is affected by fluid and elastic environments. I will then consider constrictions and the conditions necessary for a model cell to successfully pass through a constriction. For the case of constrictions smaller than the cell nucleus, I will introduce our simple model of a nucleus. As well as analysis of experimental data, I will share ideas of what we think is necessary for a cell to force its nucleus through a small constriction.

    <EventDescription>Spiroplasma is a unique, wall-less bacterium that swims by flipping the handedness of its helical shape at one end of the cell. This change in chirality moves outward from the end at constant speed, causing a kink in the cell shape to move down the length of the cell and also causing rotation of the cell body. The handedness of the cell eventually flips back to its original state at the end where the kink started, with this second kink also moving down the length of the cell until the entire cell is back its original state. An array of filaments has been found inside the cell and anchored to the cell membrane that are implicated in producing the cell shape, but how these filaments produce these traveling kinks remains mysterious. To address this question, we developed two models for creating helicity, one that involves bending and the other that involves twisting. We simulated the dynamics of Spiroplasma in the context of these two models using a new finite-volume filament dynamic algorithm that we developed. In this talk, I will describe this new algorithm and discuss how we used these simulations coupled with experimental measurements to determine whether Spiroplasma drives its motility through bend- or twist-driven mechanisms.

    <EventDescription>We present a mean-field formalism for studying firing-rate statistics of brain regions whose neurons exhibit atypical firing patterns and heterogeneous electrophysiological properties. Indeed, while mean-field formalisms have successfully modeled signaling in many brain regions, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)–the human circadian pacemaker–presents unique challenges. Namely, SCN neurons intrinsically exhibit depolarized low-amplitude membrane oscillations (DLAMOs), depolarization block (DB), and standard action potential firing, but at different times of day. Further, GABA reversal potential and molecular circadian phase of SCN neurons, among other properties, vary across the network or slowly over time. To address these challenges, our formalism consists of a system of integro-differential equations describing the time evolution of the mean and standard deviation of synaptic conductances across the network. Electrophysiological properties of SCN neurons are incorporated by computing responses to synaptic conductance inputs of a Hodgkin-Huxley-type SCN neuron model that exhibits DLAMOs and DB. Such responses are then averaged over distributions of relevant quantities and included in the differential equations. Results show that a large spread in circadian phases across SCN neurons reduces the size of oscillations in SCN network firing activity, identifying a mechanism by which systematic disruptions of neuron electrophysiology could contribute to circadian disorders.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The Functionalized Cahn–Hilliard equation has been proposed as a model for the interfacial energy of phase-separated mixtures of amphiphilic molecules. We study the existence of a nonnegative weak solutions of a gradient flow of the Functionalized Cahn–Hilliard equation subject to a degenerate mobility  that is zero for u&lt;0. Assuming the initial data is positive, we construct a weak solution as the limit of solutions corresponding to non-degenerate mobilities and verify that it satisfies an energy dissipation inequality. Our approach is a combination of Galerkin approximation, energy estimates, and weak convergence methods. We will also discuss the corresponding geometric evolution of bilayers governed by the degenerate FCH equation.

    <EventDescription>A phase field model with two phase fields, representing the concentration and the head–tail separation of amphiphilic molecules, respectively, has been constructed using an extension of the Ohta–Kawasaki model (Macromolecules, 1986, 19, 2621–2632). It is shown that this molecularly-informed phase field model is capable of producing various self-assembled amphiphilic aggregates, such as bilayers, vesicles and micelles. Furthermore, pathways connecting two opposed bilayers with a fusion pore are obtained by using a combination of the phase field model and the string method. Multiple fusion pathways, including a classical pathway and a leaky pathway, have been obtained depending on the initial separation of the two bilayers. The study shed light on the understanding of the membrane fusion pathways and, more importantly, laid a foundation for further investigation of more complex membrane morphologies and transitions.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Social distancing policies, such as extended school and workplace closures, have been widely used to control the spread of COVID-19. However, after an initial lockdown stage, societies are forced to find an equilibrium between the need to reduce contagion rates and reopen their economies. To estimate how the changes in population mixing have affected the disease’s progression, we use an age-stratified SEIR model to reconstruct the dynamics of COVID-19 in Ecuador between February and August 2020 across four different periods defined by policy interventions. Then, we apply optimal control theory to maximize the number of people returning to normal activities and minimize the number of actively infected individuals with minimal economic costs. This work allows testing reopening scenarios after the lockdown and strict social distancing policies. Finally, we compare optimal reopening strategies with strategies that suggest releasing specific age groups to reduce risk and negatively impact the economy.

    <EventDescription>Modeling a high-dimensional Hamiltonian system in reduced dimensions with respect to coarse-grained (CG) variables can greatly reduce computational cost and enable efficient bottom-up prediction of main features of the system for many applications. However, it usually experiences significantly altered dynamics due to loss of degrees of freedom upon coarse-graining. To establish CG models that can faithfully preserve dynamics, previous efforts mainly focus on equilibrium systems. In contrast, various biological systems are known out of equilibrium. Therefore, this work concerns non-equilibrium systems and enables accurate and efficient CG modeling that preserves non-equilibrium dynamics and is generally applicable to any non-equilibrium process and any observable of interest. To this end, the dynamic equation of a CG variable is built in the form of the non-stationary generalized Langevin equation (nsGLE), where the two-time memory kernel is determined from the data of the auto-correlation function of the observable of interest. By embedding the nsGLE in an extended dynamics framework, the nsGLE can be solved efficiently to predict the non-equilibrium dynamics of the CG variable.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>3D-RISM is a powerful tool for calculating solvation properties of biological molecules at infinite dilution for use in molecular modeling, drug design, and molecular biology. However, 3D-RISM can be prohibitively slow for many applications while others are densely-packed environments with periodic boundary conditions. To address this, we have implemented a number of numerical methods - treecode summation, cut-offs and periodic boundaries - in the AmberTools molecular modeling suite. Using treecode summation, we improve the scaling of 3D-RISM scaling from $O(N_\text{atom}^2)$ to $O(N_\text{atom} \ln N_\text{atom})$, enabling calculations on a microtubule with over 1.2 million atoms. We also implemented analytically corrected cut-offs for the short-ranged Lennard-Jones potential, reducing the execution time on small, drug-like molecules by a factor of 10. To account for periodic boundaries, we used particle-mesh Ewald summation, allowing 3D-RISM to be used to improve X-ray crystal structure refinement. Together, these numerical methods expand the range of problems that 3D-RISM can be applied to.

    <EventDescription>Nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) methods have been widely used to numerically solve various problems in biology, as they preserve many of the essential properties of the solutions of differential equations with no restriction on the time-step size. However, most NSFD methods developed to date are only of first-order accuracy. In this talk, we discuss the construction and analysis of a new second-order modified NSFD method for a chemostat model with microbial input and constant death rate. The proposed numerical method not only preserves the positivity of solutions and the local stability properties of equilibria, but is also of second-order accuracy. Numerical simulations are presented to support the theoretical results.

    <EventDescription>Seasonal variation affects the dynamics of many infectious diseases including influenza, cholera and malaria. The time when infectious individuals are first introduced into a population is crucial in predicting whether a major disease outbreak occurs. In this investigation, we apply a time-nonhomogeneous stochastic process for a cholera epidemic with seasonal periodicity and a multitype branching process approximation to obtain an analytical estimate for the probability of an outbreak. In particular, an analytic estimate of the probability of disease extinction is shown to satisfy a system of ordinary differential equations which follows from the backward Kolmogorov differential equation. An explicit expression for the mean (resp. variance) of the first extinction time given an extinction occurs is derived based on the analytic estimate for the extinction probability. Our results indicate that the probability of a disease outbreak, and mean and standard derivation of the first time to disease extinction are periodic in time and depend on the time when the infectious individuals or free-living pathogens are introduced. Numerical simulations are then carried out to validate the analytical predictions using two examples of the general cholera model. At the end, the developed theoretical results are extended to more general models of infectious diseases. This is joint work with Linda JS Allen.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Fibrinolysis, the enzymatic degradation of the fibrin mesh that stabilizes blood clots, is critical for preventing natural clots from becoming problematic. When ``internal' lysis initiated naturally by the body's lytic enzymes is not working properly, dangerous blood clots can form and require ``external' lysis initiated clinically by large doses of lytic enzyme. Clots can be contracted (with compressed volumes, denser fibrin networks, and a higher percentage of total fibrin on the exterior of the clot) or uncontracted (with bigger volumes, looser fibrin networks, and a more homogeneous distribution of clot components). Experimental data show that clot structure has a differential influence on internal vs. external lysis -- for example, contracted clots are more resistant than uncontracted clots to external lysis but are faster to degrade via internal lysis -- but the mechanisms responsible for these differences are unknown. We build a 3-dimensional, multiscale, stochastic model to investigate the mechanisms underlying internal and external lysis. The model includes detailed structural and biochemical features of clots and is used in conjunction with laboratory experimentation to identify conditions under which internal and external lysis are most effective. Results of this work have implications for improved clinical outcomes, as therapeutic strategies can be targeted to take advantage of (or avoid) mechanisms identified by the model.

    <EventDescription>This talk will provide an introduction to the biology of sickle cell disease and its downstream sequelae. Sickle cell disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the beta-globin chain which result in hemoglobin polymerization upon deoxygenation and subsequent red blood cell sickling. Sickling events trigger a cascade of downstream effects – including hemolysis, inflammation, and obstructions of small blood vessels – leading to ischemia, pain crisis, organ damage, and reduced life expectancy for sickle cell patients. In this minisymposium, we highlight a broad range of mathematical approaches that have been used to further understanding of different aspects of disease pathophysiology and to develop new treatment options for patients. Multi-scale models have been utilized to understand the regulation of red blood cell production, blood flow mechanics and rheology, and formation of vaso-occlusions. Statistical analysis and machine learning have also been employed to investigate frequency of pain-crises and mechanisms promoting disease progression in sickle cell patients.

    <EventDescription>We present new higher-order quadratures for a family of boundary integral operators re-derived using the approach introduced in [Kublik, Tanushev, and Tsai. J. Comp. Phys. 247: 279-311, 2013]. In this formulation, a boundary integral over a smooth, closed hypersurface is transformed into an equivalent volume integral defined in a sufficiently thin tubular neighborhood of the surface. The volumetric formulation makes it possible to use the simple trapezoidal rule on uniform Cartesian grids and relieves the need to use parameterization for developing quadrature. Consequently, typical point singularities in a layer potential extend along the surface’s normal lines. We propose new higher-order corrections to the trapezoidal rule on the grid nodes around the singularities. This correction is based on local decompositions of the singularity and is dependent on the angle of approach to the singularity relative to the surface’s principal curvature directions. The proposed decomposition, combined with the volumetric formulation, leads to a special quadrature error cancellation.

    <EventDescription>Recently, information dynamics have
taken center stage in our collective understandings
of science, risk, and decision making.  Surprisingly,
while a great deal of studies have addressed information
dynamics in human populations, the scope of mathematical
theory on the topic is quite limited and often overly 
complex.  Here, I'll present a simplified theoretical
model that captures several well-known aspects of 
information dynamics within a single model and can be
adapted to represent a wide set of phenomena and their
resolutions.

    <EventDescription>With an aging population, atrial fibrillation (AF) affects 2.7 million to 6.7 million people in the United States [Du, X et al, J Am Coll Cardiol., 69(15):1968-1982, 2017]. Although the CHA$_2$DS$_2$VASC score is the most used risk-stratification scoring system to guide AF treatment, the measurement lacks personalization. To overcome this limitation, many researchers have started creating patient-specific computer simulations of AF. One of the challenges faced in creating such models is the complexity of the atrial muscle arrangement. This work proposes a semi-automated rule-based algorithm for left atrial (LA) myofiber construction. The transmural fibers produced by our algorithm generate similar electrical activation patterns compared to those generated using existing approaches that are more complex. Current approaches for defining the orientation of the atrial fiber bundles either require the definition of hundreds of landmarks or are overly simplistic. The notable advantage of our approach is the ability to capture the main LA fiber bundles while solving only seven harmonic fields, leading to a straightforward and reproducible approach. Finally, our method is easily extendable to non-trivial configurations of pulmonary veins that are common among AF patients.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Pathogens rely on their host for reproduction and changes in primary producer nutrition can thus alter their disease dynamics. Pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, generally have higher nutritional demands and are stoichiometrically less flexible than primary producers. Increases in nutrient supply may thus more strongly enhance the performance of pathogens relative to their host. The consequences of shifts in nutrient availability for disease dynamics also will depend on changes in host immunity. For example, a growth-defense trade-off may lead to reduced resistance when increased nutrient availability enhances host growth and thus further increases disease prevalence. In contrast, host immunity may also rely on nutrients directly, for example on nitrogen that is used to produce nitrogen-based compounds or build nitrogen-rich enzymatic machinery, which may lead to enhanced host resistance with increasing nitrogen availability. Here, we explored the role of nitrogen availability on infection dynamics of a primary producer host and its pathogen using a stoichiometric, disease model. Specifically, we tested how changes in nitrogen investments in host immune response will alter host biomass build-up and pathogen infection rates.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In the decades since Art Winfree’s pioneering work on phase models for nonlinear, high-dimensional oscillators, the overwhelming majority of theoretical analysis in this field has been performed in the weakly perturbed limit.  Comparatively very little is understood about limit cycle oscillators in response to arbitrary, strong perturbations, mostly due to the lack of viable reduction strategies for considering large magnitude inputs.  

In this presentation, I will discuss recent work that uses isostable coordinates, which characterize level sets of the slowest decaying eigenmodes of the Koopman operator, in conjunction with phase-based techniques to yield analytically tractable reduced order models that are valid in the strongly perturbed regime.  Applications involving phase resetting of circadian rhythms following rapid travel across multiple time zones, elimination of a cardiac arrhythmia that represents a precursor to cardiac arrest, and phase locking of neural rhythms in response to strong synaptic coupling illustrate the utility of these new methods in situations where standard, phase-only techniques fail.  Data-driven methods for inference of phase-isostable-based models will also be discussed for use when the underlying dynamical equations are unknown or unavailable.

    <EventDescription>

The effect of population structure on evolutionary dynamics is a long-lasting research topic in evolutionary ecology and population genetics. Evolutionary graph theory is a popular approach to this problem, where individuals are located on the nodes of a network and can replace each other via links. 
We study the effect of complex network structure on the fixation probability, but instead of networks of individuals, we model a network of sub-populations with a probability of migration between them. 
We ask how the structure of such a meta-population and the rate of migration affect the fixation probability. Many of the known results for networks of individuals carry over to meta-populations, in particular for regular networks or low symmetric migration probabilities. However, when patch sizes differ we find interesting deviations between structured meta-populations and networks of individuals. For example, a two-patch structure with unequal population size suppresses selection for low migration probabilities. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Bacterial motility and growth play central roles in agriculture, the environment, and medicine. While bacterial behavior is typically studied in bulk liquid or on flat surfaces, many bacterial habitats--e.g., soils, sediments, and biological gels/tissues--are complex and crowded spaces. In this talk, I will describe my group's work using tools from soft matter and applied mathematics to address this gap in knowledge. In particular, using studies of E. coli, we demonstrate how confinement in a crowded medium fundamentally alters bacterial behavior. In particular, we show how the paradigm of run-and-tumble motility is dramatically altered by pore-scale confinement, both for cells performing undirected motion and those performing chemotaxis, directed motion in response to a chemical stimulus. Furthermore, we show how spatial variations in the ability of cells to perform chemotaxis enable populations to autonomously stabilize large-scale perturbations in their overall morphology. Taken together, our work thus helps to reveal new principles to predict and control the organization of bacteria, and active matter in general, in complex and crowded environments.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Emerging clinical evidence suggests that thrombosis in the microvasculature of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) plays an essential role in dictating the disease progression. Herein, we employ a novel multiscale and multiphysics computational framework to perform predictive modeling of the pathological thrombus formation in the microvasculature using data from patients with COVID-19. Our simulation results show that among the coagulation factors considered, antithrombin and factor V play more prominent roles in promoting thrombosis. Our simulations also suggest that recruitment of WBCs to the endothelial cells exacerbates thrombogenesis and contributes to the blockage of the blood flow. Additionally, we show that the recent identification of flowing blood cell clusters could be a result of detachment of WBCs from thrombogenic sites, which may serve as a nidus for new clot formation. These findings point to potential targets that should be further evaluated, and prioritized in the anti-thrombotic treatment of patients with COVID-19. Altogether, our computational framework provides a powerful tool for quantitative understanding of the mechanism of pathological thrombus formation and offers insights into new therapeutic approaches for treating COVID-19 associated thrombosis.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Sickle cell pain presents in acute episodes in pediatric patients, as opposed to the chronic pain observed in adults. The episodic nature of pain events in pediatric patients necessitates a distinct approach from what has been used to mathematically model pain severity levels in adults. Statistical studies have examined interactions between sleep actigraphy measurements --- like sleep quality and sleep efficiency --- and pain levels in pediatric populations, and we propose a framework for modeling pediatric pain dynamics that incorporates the effects of sleep actigraphy and electronic survey data over varying time windows. We hypothesize that cumulative effects of these measurements will be more important than daily measurements in both replicating pain severity levels and determining markers of a pain episode. The ability to identify markers preceding the onset of a pain episode will be crucial in improving patient quality of life. We present work in progress towards developing this modeling framework.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cardiac alternans has been associated with an increased propensity to malignant tachyarrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (VT/VF). Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the utility of alternans in predicting the onset of VT/VF, with heightened levels of alternans reported to occur in conjunction with arrhythmic episodes. Sharp upsurges in alternans have been documented in patients with coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, as well as acute heart failure. Moreover, increase in alternans has been shown to correlate with elevated sympathetic activity in humans, while the amplitude of alternans has been shown to diminish with ß-blockers. It has been proposed that prevention and control of alternans could inhibit the onset of impending lethal tachyarrhythmias. Here, in a series of preclinical and clinical studies, the utility of cardiac alternans as a biomarker of disease progression was investigated. Preclinical data investigating the potential of alternans in characterizing the electrophysiological substrates that predispose the heart to malignant arrhythmias, specifically during chronic myocardial infarction is presented. Furthermore, the use of alternans to serve as a marker for guiding anti-arrhythmic treatment in patients susceptible to tachyarrhythmias, both atrial and ventricular, by identifying dynamic changes in diseased substrates and quantifying the response to therapy, is evaluated.

    <EventDescription>Blebs are pressure-driven protrusions that have been observed in cells undergoing apoptosis, cytokinesis, or migration, including tumor cells that use blebs to escape their organs of origin. Mathematical models have been previously developed to understand either bleb expansion (using fluid mechanics) or the bleb life cycle including both expansion and healing by cortex reformation (using an excitable dynamical system). Here, we introduce a simple stochastic pressure-driven cell migration model in 1D, which connects sub-cellular adhesion process and cell migration dynamics. We focus on how intrinsic noise from molecular interaction of cortex components can generate stochastic membrane-cortex separation, which allows cells to migrate by hydrostatic pressure. The incorporation of this stochastic initiation mechanism allows for the simulation of repeated blebbing events and thus continuous cell movement. We study the statistics of the blebbing events using a renewal process approximation and then derive a Langevin equation of cell migration by matching the asymptotic moments of the approximation process. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Bacterial chemotaxis -- a fundamental example of directional navigation in the living world -- is key to many biological processes, including the spreading of bacterial infections. Many bacterial species were recently reported to exhibit several distinct swimming modes -- the flagella may, for example, push the cell body or wrap around it. How do the different run modes shape the chemotaxis strategy of a multimode swimmer? Here, we investigate chemotactic motion of the soil bacterium \textit{Pseudomonas putida} as a model organism. By simultaneously tracking the position of the cell body and the configuration of its flagella, we demonstrate that individual run modes show different chemotactic responses in nutrition gradients and, thus, constitute distinct behavioral states. On the basis of an active particle model, we demonstrate that switching between multiple run states that differ in their speed and responsiveness provides the basis for robust and efficient chemotaxis in complex natural habitats, for details see Alirezaeizanjani et al. \textit{Sci. Adv.} 2020; \textbf{6} : eaaz6153.

    <EventDescription>Mathematical models for coagulation consist in a set of ordinary differential equations whose parameters (reaction rates) and initial conditions (species concentrations) are uncertain due to physiological variability, limited knowledge of some mechanisms and measurements inaccuracy. Making the models useful in the current efforts towards a better understanding of coagulation requires knowing how thrombin production depends on these uncertain inputs. The Monte Carlo approach, where about $10^4-10^5$ simulations are performed with randomly selected input values, is generally used in the literature. This methodology is accurate but time consuming and hardly tractable for complex models (e.g. including spatial heterogeneities due to flow). A more efficient strategy is investigated in this study. Sensitivity coefficients are first assessed at low cost by solving a properly designed set of adjoint linear differential equations; the accuracy of the method is demonstrated from comparisons with derivatives assessed by finite differences. The dimension of the problem is then reduced to overcome the curse of dimensionality of uncertainty quantification analysis. In the case of a model of the extrinsic pathway with 79 input [Butenas et al., 2004], it is shown that one or two independent active variables are enough to represent the variability of thrombin production. A low order model based on these active variables can then be used to perform a Monte Carlo analysis at low cost.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>We present an analysis of activity patterns in a neuronal network that consists of three mutually inhibitory neurons with voltage-sensitive piecewise smooth coupling. One of the observed propagating solutions appears to be contrary to the network architecture and is characterized by a sudden “turn-around” of trajectories during fast transitions between quasi-stable states. Standard fast-slow analysis fails to describe the mechanism underlying this activity pattern due to the voltage-sensitive nature of the coupling. We exploit the piecewise smooth nature of the coupling and consider a sequence of fast subsystems defined in a piecewise way. 

Our analysis shows that there are three possible scenarios during fast jumps, which may depend on both the fast dynamics and the slow dynamics. First, the fast dynamics may succeed to equilibrate at (or near) a critical manifold, after which the slow dynamics relaxes to its own fixed point. Second, while the fast dynamics tries to equilibrate to a critical manifold, the slow dynamics may push the fast system through a bifurcation, which forces a second fast jump to a new critical manifold. Third, the presumed critical manifold may be lost prior to fast subsystem equilibration, through effects that may relate to either the slow dynamics or the fast dynamics, in which case the fast dynamics is forced to approach a new critical manifold directly. In the second and third cases, we observe the sudden “turn-around” during fast jumps.

    <EventDescription>Once we design a mathematical system that could explain our biological phenomena, it still requires additional work such as determining system parameters or non-homogeneous terms, called system variables. This study provides a method for estimating system variables using deep neural networks equipped with mathematical theories. We also present our results using simulation and experimental data.

    <EventDescription>At the onset of sensory stimulation, the variability and co-variability of spiking activity is widely reported to decrease, especially in cortex. Considering the potential benefits of such decreased variability for coding, it has been suggested
that this could be a general principle governing all sensory systems. Here we show that this is not so. We recorded mitral cells in olfactory bulb (OB) of rats and found increased variability and co-variability of spiking at the onset of olfactory stimulation. Using models and analysis, we predicted that these increases arise due to network interactions within OB, without increasing variability of input from the nose. We tested and confirmed this prediction in awake animals with direct optogenetic stimulation of OB to circumvent the pathway through the nose.  Our results establish increases in spiking variability at stimulus onset as a viable alternative coding strategy to the more commonly observed decreases in variability in many cortical systems.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription> Both conventional wisdom and empirical evidence suggest that arranging a prior commitment or agreement before an interaction takes place enhances the chance of reaching mutual cooperation. Yet it is not clear  what mechanisms might underlie  the participation in and compliance with such  a commitment, especially when participation is costly and non-compliance can be  profitable. Here, we develop a theory of participation  and compliance with respect to an explicit commitment formation process and to institutional incentives where individuals, at first, decide  whether or not to join a cooperative agreement to play a one-shot social dilemma game. Using a mathematical model, we determine whether and when participating in a costly commitment, and complying with it, is an evolutionary stable strategy,  resulting in high levels of cooperation. We show that, given a sufficient budget for providing incentives, rewarding of commitment compliant behaviours better promotes cooperation than punishment of non-compliant ones. Moreover, by sparing part of this  budget for rewarding those willing to participate in a  commitment,  to both reward and punishment the overall level  of cooperation can be  significantly enhanced. Finally,  the presence of mistakes in deciding to  participate favours evolutionary stability of commitment compliance  and cooperation.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Anthocyanins are polyphenolic compounds that make major contributions to red, purple and blue colours of flowers, fruit and young red wine. These pigments have potential industrial applications as alternatives to synthetic food colours and as pH-dependent indicators of product freshness and quality. The ability to accurately measure and predict anthocyanin behaviour across many scientific disciplines (e.g., plant physiology, pollination ecology, food and wine science) is therefore essential, but quantitative information for anthocyanin dynamics in biological and chemical systems is currently limited. 

We used predictive mathematical modelling and chemical analysis techniques to characterise complex reaction kinetics involving model anthocyanin, malvidin-3-glucoside (M3G). In particular, kinetic modelling was conducted to represent the process of intermolecular copigmentation, which contributes to anthocyanin colour stabilisation in plants and red wine. Fourier analysis techniques were also used to analyse empirical data for M3G, with the aim of enhancing data fidelity within laboratories and wineries. 

Overall, such predictive modelling may help optimise the use of raw materials (e.g., grape) within anthocyanin-containing systems while minimising the human and physical resources that are typically required for phenolic monitoring. Furthermore, the ability to mitigate undesirable colour loss could increase opportunities for commercial use of anthocyanin-based products.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The emergence of complex tissue patterns from seemingly uniform, undifferentiated cells during development is an essential feature of all multicellular organisms. One of the most prominent theoretical mechanisms often invoked to explain biological pattern formation is the reaction-diffusion (RD) model, which postulates that local activation of pattern differentiation factors combined with long-range inhibition of the activity of those factors can produce dynamic, self-organizing spatial patterns. Numerous empirical and simulation studies have suggested that the RD mechanism underlies a wide range of pattern formation processes. However, we still know very little about the actual genes encoding the hypothetical activation and inhibition factors in most empirical systems, even less about the biophysical properties of these factors where candidate genes have been identified, and virtually nothing about how modulation of the properties of these activators and inhibitors affects pattern evolution in nature. Here I describe our work addressing these three fundamental questions by studying the development and evolution of anthocyanin pigment spots or stripes in monkeyflowers, with a suite of approaches including fluorescence imaging, genetic mapping, transgenic manipulation, and mathematical modeling.

    <EventDescription>Differentiation within multicellular organisms is a complex process that helps to establish spatial patterning and tissue formation. Often, the differentiation of cells is governed by morphogens and intercellular signaling molecules that help to guide the fate of each cell. Here, we couple a synthetic co-repressive toggle switch to intercellular signaling pathways to create a “quorum-sensing toggle”.  Our experimental results suggest that this circuit alters the emergent patterns of differentiation in colonies grown on agar containing an externally supplied morphogen. To understand the observed patterns, we developed a coupled 3D PDE-ODE system that takes into account colony expansion. Our bifurcation analysis and simulation results suggest that degradation, diffusion, and sequestration of the signaling molecules are critical to the observed patterns.

    <EventDescription>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and precursor to cardiac diseases. Catheter ablation is associated with limited success rates in patients with persistent AF, and existing mapping systems fail to identify target sites for ablation. 

We evaluated the performance of multiscale frequency (MSF), kurtosis (Kt), and multiscale entropy (MSE) techniques to identify the AF drivers using unipolar and bipolar electrograms (EGMs) obtained from numerical simulations under different clinical scenarios: in the presence of noise, scar, and various catheters. We also developed a “similarity score” to  identify the spatial location of active sites of arrhythmia in patients with AF.

Our numerical simulation results demonstrate that MSF, MSE and Kt were able to accurately identify AF drivers from EGMs for the case of Multielectrode Multispline and Grid catheters. The presence of noise and scar tissue did not significantly affect the performance of the techniques. In patients, “similarity score” was proposed and validated to identify spatial active AF sites that were observed only in patients with unsuccessful AF termination, suggesting that these active sites were missed during the ablation procedure.

In summary, AF drivers can be successfully identified in numerical simulations from EGMs under various clinical scenarios using MSF, MSE and Kt techniques, and in patients with unsuccessful AF termination after catheter ablation using “similarity score”.

    <EventDescription>During heart rhythm disorders, complex spatiotemporal patterns of electrical excitation emerge in the heart muscle. Among these patterns are self-sustaining rotating waves called rotors, spiral waves or scroll waves. In the classical description, rotors are turning around a phase singularity point that extends into a filament curve in 3 spatial dimensions. Recent results defy this viewpoint and suggest that rotor cores that form around a conduction block line are in fact extended phase discontinuities or phase defects, similar to a branch cut in complex analysis. 

Here we present a new topological framework in 2 and 3 spatial dimensions that unifies the concepts of conduction block, rotor cores, phase defects and filaments. We show how different building blocks of co-dimension 0, 1 and 2 are topologically related and shed new light on the processes of rotor creation and annihilation. Our framework is applied to analyse in silico and real-life experiments.

    <EventDescription>Pyramidal cells (PCs) in the brain are known to encode incoming sensory information to give rise to perception and behavior. Understanding how this works is complicated by the fact that neural activities are governed by both the combined activities of interacting neuronal populations and by individual neurons that show different firing patterns (including tonic spiking and bursting) in response to incoming signals. We have recently expanded a previously developed HH model of PC neurons to include not only the intrinsic electrical properties of the cell, but also Ca2+ mobilization across the cell and ER membrane (i.e., the various calcium fluxes through channels and pumps), the small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels as well as the overall synaptic inputs (i.e., mean activity of EPSPs and IPSPs). Our goal was to explore how these four factors affect bursting in PCs. The model was parametrized using in vivo recordings of PCs in the ELL, including interspike interval distribution. Using bifurcation theory and slow-fast analysis, we explained how the firing activity of PCs switch between different states (including quiescence, bursting and tonic spiking) when modifying the calcium dynamics and what the underlying mechanism of burst oscillation is. Our results align with experimental findings that show neuromodulatory serotonergic input can strongly enhance burst firing by downregulating SK channels. In this talk, I will provide a summary of these findings.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Malaria is a disease endemic in areas encompassing over half the world’s population. It remains detrimental to the health and livelihood of millions of individuals causing over 200 million cases a year and nearly half a million deaths. \textit{Plasmodium} parasites, the causative agents of malaria, have a complex life cycle requiring two hosts – a vertebrate, such as a human, and the \textit{Anopheles} mosquito. During the time in each of these hosts, the population dynamics of the parasite are quite variable in density and stage. In earlier work, we showed how density of parasite stages alters the timing and probability of disease spread at both interfaces of transmission: human to mosquito and mosquito to human. Here, we bridge previous stochastic within-host modeling of parasite dynamics and diversity in the human and the mosquito to investigate consequences for transmission. We use a multi-scale model that tracks parasite dynamics and diversity, represented as genetically different variants, through the cycle of malaria infection. We track the density and persistence of these genetically diverse parasites.  The extent of parasite diversity has important implications not only for disease severity but also for spread of the disease within the human and mosquito populations.

    <EventDescription>Variational implicit solvation models (VISM), because of their relatively low computational cost and satisfactory accuracy, are of paramount importance in the solvation analysis of biological and chemical systems at molecular level. Central in the construction of VSIM is an interface separating the solute and the solvent, which is obtained by optimizing a solvation energy functional. However, due to the random conformational changes of macromolecules, the disposition of a separating interface cannot be unique. Further, the idea of using the value of a solvation energy functional computed at a fixed interface to predict experimentally observed solvation energies is undermined by the fact that experimentally observable quantities are ensemble averaged.

In this talk, we will introduce how to use a VISM with a "diffuse interface" to calculate ensemble average solvation energy. The new model is rigorously analyzed and new numerical methods are developed.

    <EventDescription>The recently developed Gaussian Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) models can not only provide a surface-free approach for electrostatics, but also capture the atomic details in the continuum modelling by using atom-specific heterogeneous dielectric values. In this talk, we will focus on singular point charges of the Gaussian PB model, which are Dirac delta functions. The usual trilinear interpolation of partial charges is known to introduce large numerical artifact or grid energy. To completely eliminate the grid energy, a novel regularization method is developed. In particular, a dual decomposition of potential and dielectric function is carried out, so that the charge singularities can be analytically captured by the Coulomb potential, while the reaction field potential satisfies a regularized PB equation with a new source term. Mathematical analysis has been conducted to show that a super-Gaussian density, instead of a Gaussian one, is required for the source term being well defined in the sense of distribution. Moreover, the well-posedness of the regularized formulation has been proved, and the regularity of the weak solution has been clarified. Numerical tests have been conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed regularization.

    <EventDescription>Hemostasis is the process by which a blood clot forms to prevent bleeding at the site of an injury. The formation time, size, and structure of a blood clot depends on the local hemodynamics and the nature of the injury. We have previously developed computational models to study intravascular clotting, a process confined to the interior of a vessel. Modeling extravascular injuries, where blood leaks from a vessel into extravascular space, requires a set of new computational tools for the complex geometries that simulate the injury.  Similar to our previous intravascular model, our new model of extravascular clotting uses a continuum approach to track the advection, diffusion, and aggregation of platelet densities in a dynamic fluid environment. The transport of platelet densities into any spatial location is limited by the platelet fraction that already resides within that location, i.e., the densities satisfy a maximum packing constraint using a hindered transport coefficient.  We use a finite volume method on a nonuniform mesh in an “H” shaped geometry. Our computational model simulates platelet aggregation in an analogous in vitro microfluidic model. We use kinetic and occlusion time data from the microfluidic model to develop and validate our computational model. Results from the computations and experiments showed that the formation of a blood clot occludes the injury channel and stops flow from escaping while blood in the main vessel retains its fluidity.

    <EventDescription>The anuclear blood cells, platelets, form blood clots in human vessels. Dysfunction of platelets is observed in various hereditary and acquired diseases. Our team developed a system of experimental tests that allows us to characterize platelet functioning in healthy donors and patients. In parallel, a mechanistic computer model of intracellular signaling in platelets was developed, simulating the main functional responses of platelets to activation by thrombin, ADP, collagen and podoplanin.
Platelet responses are known to have stochastic nature; therefore, we integrated the developed model by means of the tau-leap stochastic modeling approach and thus described platelet subpopulation formation. Further analysis of the model allowed us to determine the number of activated receptors as the origin of stochasticity in the platelet signaling network. To facilitate incorporation of the platelet signaling model in models of thrombus formation, we performed a reduction of the core system of ordinary differential equations using the Tikhonov's theorem. 
The constructed computational model allowed identification of mechanisms of platelet dysfunction in patients with immune thrombocytopenia and with Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome. Therefore, we utilized a set of experimental techniques to observe patient-specific features in platelet functioning and developed a pipeline for the construction of patient-specific platelet signaling model.

    <EventDescription>Painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) are a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). The mechanism by which VOC is triggered remains elusive but we believe that the autonomic nervous system plays a role in the genesis of VOC. We hypothesized that abnormal autonomic control of peripheral vasoconstriction in SCD could lead to higher probability of rigid sickled cells getting lodged in the microcirculation. Collective microvascular obstruction could then lead to large scale VOC. To test this hypothesis, we employed a Laguerre-Volterra model to decompose the pain-induced vasoconstriction response. The most salient features of the identified dynamics were extracted to represent the biophysical markers of autonomic and vascular impairment in SCD and healthy controls. This approach allowed us to deduce which (functional) mechanisms contributed to the stronger pain-induced vasoconstriction response observed in SCD compared to controls. Next, we sought to determine whether there is a causal link between naturally-occurring peripheral vasoconstriction during sleep and the incidence of VOC. We detected vasoconstriction events from fingertip photoplethysmograms acquired from SCD subjects in a prospective multi-center cohort sleep study. Using a statistical model, we found that a higher propensity to vasoconstrict, quantified by the median of overnight vasoconstriction magnitude, predicted more frequent VOC events.

    <EventDescription>Cells can cooperate by producing diffusible growth factors that confer a fitness benefit on surrounding cells. For example, several mutations associated with malignancy rely on growth factor production. The evolution of cooperation has been extensively studied using game-theoretic models, and it is known that population structure and update dynamics play an important role in the resulting dynamics. Cell populations within the body are organised into tissues, such as epithelia, which form skin and the linings of our organs. These are dynamic structures, not easily represented by evolutionary graph theory models, which are traditionally used to incorporate population structure into evolutionary modelling. We thus use the Voronoi tessellation model to more realistically represent the population dynamics of an epithelium. Considering evolutionary games within this context, we are able to explore how the properties of an epithelium, in particular, the coupling of death and division, affect the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation.

    <EventDescription>Political theorists have long argued that a pluralistic republic can combat the dangers of factions by enlarging the political sphere to include a greater diversity of interests. While the scope of politics has expanded over the past 75 years, polarization is markedly worse. Motivated by this paradox, we take a bottom-up approach to explore how partisan individual-level dynamics in a multidimensional issue space can shape collective-level factionalization. We extend a model of cultural evolution grounded in evolutionary game theory, in which partisanship determines the likelihood of cross-party learning and the interaction network changes endogenously according to individual interests. We find that while expanding interest diversity can indeed improve both individual and collective outcomes, increasingly high partisan bias promotes a reduction in issue dimensionality via party-based assortment, promoting polarization. Extreme partisan bias can boost interindividual cooperation, creating a tug-of-war between individual cooperation and societal cohesion. These dangers of extreme partisanship are highest when interests are heavily shaped by peer learning, with little independent exploration. Our results highlight the need to study polarization in a coupled, multilevel context.

    <EventDescription>Humans and other organisms are capable of quickly making flexible decisions in dynamic and noisy environments. The processes by which this flexibility arises are not well understood, posing a challenge to modeling complex choice behaviors, and for building realistic artificial decision-making agents. In this minisymposium, we will explore data-driven models of stochastic decision making, focusing on decisions in complex or variable environments. Talks will feature speakers with specialties ranging from theoretical model development to model validation using experimental data, and will have broad application to stochastic optimization, systems control, and computational neuroscience.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Sickle cell disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the beta-globin chain which result in hemoglobin polymerization upon deoxygenation and subsequent red blood cell sickling. Sickling events trigger a cascade of downstream effects – including hemolysis, inflammation, and obstructions of small blood vessels – leading to ischemia, pain crisis, organ damage, and reduced life expectancy for sickle cell patients. In this minisymposium, we highlight a broad range of mathematical approaches that have been used to further understanding of different aspects of disease pathophysiology and to develop new treatment options for patients. Multi-scale models have been utilized to understand the regulation of red blood cell production, blood flow mechanics and rheology, and formation of vaso-occlusions. Statistical analysis and machine learning have also been employed to investigate frequency of pain-crises and mechanisms promoting disease progression in sickle cell patients. Speakers for the minisymposium are selected from academia and industry to foster discussions and potential future collaborations. Another aim for this minisymposium is to increase awareness of sickle cell disease burden and to invite the SIAM Life Sciences community to contribute to the development of new mathematical models and techniques that can ultimately improve quality of life outlook for sickle cell patients.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Biological processes are incredibly complex, ranging a plethora of spatial and temporal scales and depending sensitively on the interactions of their constitutive parts.  For instance, a neuron's regulation of axonal length depends on unimpeded transport of molecular motors. In a synthetic biology lab, diffusive communication between bacterial cells in a growing colony leads to shifting spatiotemporal patterns in response to externally supplied morphogen. The emergence of a pandemic depends on a complex network of individuals who interact improperly. In each case the behavior of a macroscopic structure is influenced by microscopic interactions and vice versa. 

Mathematical models have a longstanding tradition of furthering understanding of such complex biological processes. Models are flexible and capture dynamics at a multitude of scales, be simple enough to focus on big picture dynamics, or unveil how the landscape of a particular species in an environment changes. Even reductionist models have provided valuable insights regarding underlying mechanisms of complex biological processes. However, to understand a complex system, more sophisticated models are required.

This minisymposium will feature talks describing models of a variety of biological processes at a multitude of scales.  The insights provided by these models will be discussed as well as the challenges in relating them to less mathematically inclined experimentalists to apply such insights in practice.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cardiac cell models have proliferated from early simple descriptions to various species- and cell-specific models, covering a number of experimental and clinical situations. Moreover, models now include disease-specific cases (such as heart failure or channel mutations) and sub-cellular processes, especially relating to intracellular calcium dynamics. These specialized models are key in describing the pathologies of the heart. Their development requires integrating structural and functional cell data, as well as taking into account biological variability. This minisymposium gathers researchers from theoretical, data-driven, and experimental fields to consider specialized cardiac modeling and the transfer of cardiac modeling results to the growing field of personalized medicine.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Many biological systems in neurophysiology, immunology and cellular biology exhibit rhythmic activities that can occur over multiple time scales ranging from slow to fast. The underlying  dynamics of the mathematical models describing these biological systems are quite complex and require the use of slow-fast analysis as a method to decipher their behaviour. While this method is quite powerful in determining how the interaction of times scales regulate rhythmicity in these systems, it has to be adapted closely to the specifics of the models under consideration. In this minisymposium, we will explore the applications of slow-fast analysis to investigate the dynamics of several biological systems and how it is adapted to the models used.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The global pandemic has put a spotlight on epidemiological research and the value of mathematical models to predict the time course of the disease dynamics in the presence of vaccines, treatments, and behavior adaptation such as social distancing. These special sessions feature researchers in epidemiology working on a wide variety of diseases such as HIV, COVID-19, Cancer, and Malaria.  The types of models considered span ODE models, PDE models, and integral equations and use a variety of techniques from statistics, data-fitting, and epi-genetics.  These special sessions provide a broad sampling of current work in mathematical epidemiology that help shed light on the underlying biological processes
and highlight the importance of predictive mathematical modeling as a foundation for policy decisions.  Speakers span from early career graduate students, postdoctoral fellows to faculty with established research programs.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Across settings ranging from molecular evolution to human social systems, the dynamics of competition and cooperation help to shape the world around us. Evolutionary game theory provides a flexible framework for exploring the ways in which traits and behaviors spread through populations via natural selection or social learning, allowing us to understand how interactions between individuals can promote emergent phenomena at the population level. In this session, we hope to bring together researchers using game-theoretic approaches to study scientific questions ranging from bacterial cooperation and the evolutionary dynamics of cancer to the establishment of cooperative social institutions and the sustainable management of common-pool resources. Mathematically, our speakers will draw upon analytical and computation techniques from stochastic processes, ordinary and partial differential equations, and network science to describe the long-time dynamics of both finite and infinite populations. A main goal for our session is to highlight recent theoretical and applied advances in evolutionary game theory, and to promote cross-fertilization of ideas for game-theoretic modeling arising from different mathematical approaches and from areas of application including ecology, oncology, economics, and sociology.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Bacterial chemotaxis has been widely and extensively studied through experimental insights into the behavior of bacteria on the individual and population scale, coupled with mathematical models. This minisymposium brings together mathematicians and experimentalists working on the chemotactic behavior of bacteria at various scales. In one part, we will explore how an individual cell responds to change in their environment and suggest mathematical models or physical principles, guided by the recent experimental findings of bacterial chemotaxis on the individual cell scale. In the other part, we will consider applying mathematical modeling to understand the behavior of bacterial populations, a range from a classical Keller-Segel model to the multiscale modeling of the bacterial population.
The minisymposium is expected to foster collaborations among participants and is expected to enable the translation of theoretical research to experiments and subsequently to practice.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The rapid development of medical imaging and computing powers enables scientists to better understand and explore the biological systems from the atomic, molecular, and cellular levels. For complex biological systems involving different time and spatial scales, multiscale modeling is extremely useful to track down the interested details and obtain necessary large pictures concurrently.  Meanwhile simulating the systems at multiscale within feasible time and memory calls for the development of theoretical and numerical algorithms. This minisymposium aims to serve as a platform for promoting interdisciplinary research by bringing together experts from different areas involved in modeling, methodology, and applications of multiscale complex systems.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The formation of a blood clot is a complex biochemical and biophysical process that occurs on multiple spatial and temporal scales, and under various flow conditions. Significant bleeding or thrombosis, the pathological formation of a blood clot, can result from defects and perturbations in the clotting system. Due to the complexity of this system, the various responses and their underlying mechanisms are challenging to predict. Mathematical models of blood clot formation and coagulation can help interpret experimental data, elucidate unknown biochemical and biophysical mechanisms, and serve as predictive tools. In this minisymposium, speakers will present new computational and mathematical approaches used to understand the complexity of the clotting system.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The emergence of spatiotemporal patterns has been observed throughout biology, and explored within mathematical models that often rely on underlying assumptions about symmetry. However, symmetry is rarely perfect in real life, and at least some level of disorder is largely unavoidable. Entropy can be used to characterize disorder, asymmetry and information flow in a wide range of biological settings. The goal of this two-part session will be to explore how the concepts of symmetry and entropy might provide insights into the dynamics and robustness of living systems.  The first part will focus on the juxtaposition between exact symmetries that underlie mathematical models and approximate symmetries in real systems, as well as strategies for maintaining resilience.  The second part will delve into interpretations of entropy and information flow in living systems.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>This session will introduce the method of Koopman operators for data-driven and theoretical analysis (and design) of synthetic and natural gene networks.  We will first begin with a gentle introduction to the method of Koopman with two theoretical examples.  Next, we will introduce basic numerical methods for estimating Koopman operators of physical systems, especially biological networks, and discuss the visualization of learned representations of Koopman operators.   We will then survey deep learning or machine learning strategies for learning Koopman operators, in particular, deep dynamic mode decomposition as a means for discovering invariant subspaces of Koopman observables.   Lastly, I will survey applications of Koopman operator theory in the analysis of synthetic gene circuits and natural, complex gene networks for systems biology and genome engineering applications.    

Attendees of this tutorial course will then perform hands-on analysis of a basic low-dimensional biological dataset, developing their own dynamic mode decomposition algorithm to analyze localized dynamics.   Attendees will then be provided a step-by-step tutorial of how to develop their own deep dynamic mode decomposition algorithm in Keras to analyze high temporal resolution biological data.  Lastly, attendees will attempt to perform modal decomposition and analysis of  high-dimensional data for the selection of genetic targets for sensing and control.   Attendees should bring a computer with Python and Keras installed; skeleton code will be provided as a launchpad.

    <EventDescription>Whether they seek to better understand how cells organize during early development or want to predict how a disease will spread in a population, mathematicians draw on many of the same techniques when building models informed by data. This mini-tutorial will be broken into three separate sections: a survey of data-driven mathematical modeling, parameter estimation, and uncertainty quantification. We will address common difficulties with fitting models to data, including how to select appropriate statistical models, how to assess whether the estimates are “good enough”, and how much data is needed to accurately parameterize a mathematical model. Participants will gain experience in each topic through the use of hands-on code. 

With the goal of providing a springboard to participants for future research in data-driven modeling, we will take a survey-style approach throughout and include pointers to references and code repositories. We will also briefly discuss current research questions that are complementary to data-driven modeling, including techniques from topological data analysis.

    <EventDescription>A large body of evidence shows that spontaneous behavioral changes deeply influence the course of an epidemic. In particular, when the disease-protective tools are not mandatory, the individual choice to use them is determined by the circulating information and rumors. In the framework of the behavioral epidemiology of infectious diseases [Manfredi and d’Onofrio (eds.), Springer 2013], the method of information-dependent models has been successfully applied to vaccine-preventable pediatric diseases and is increasingly being used. It is based on the introduction in the epidemic model of a new variable: the information index, which is defined in terms of a delay, a memory kernel and a function which describes the information that is relevant to the public in determining the choice to adopt the protective tool. We illustrate the basic idea of this approach and provide some recent applications related to (or inspired by) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Precisely, we qualitatively investigate how the curbing of an epidemic can be affected by the information-dependent compliance to non-pharmaceutical interventions [Buonomo and Della Marca, Roy Soc Open Sci 2020] and hesitance about the vaccines [Buonomo et al., J Theor Biol 2022]. From a mathematical point of view, information-dependent quantities may lead to complex dynamical patterns, including sustained oscillations and hysteresis phenomena.

    <EventDescription>The presence of myelin is a powerful structural factor that controls conduction velocity of mammalian axons. It is the combination of local synaptic activity and non-local delayed axonal interactions within the cortex that is believed to be the major source of large-scale brain signals that are seen in EEG/MEG recordings. In this talk, I will aim to combine perspectives from neural mass and network modelling and develop a new set of mathematical tools able to unravel the contributions of space-dependent axonal delays to large-scale spatio-temporal patterning of brain activity. I will first analyse a single neuronal population model with self-feedback and a fixed delay and show how to construct periodic orbits for a Heaviside firing rate and perform linear stability analysis by augmenting Floquet theory with saltation operations, and determine arising bifurcations. Then I will consider a ring of N scalar nodes with distance-dependent delays and show how to reduce this to a system with just two lags. Subsequently, I will show how to perform stability and bifurcation analysis of network states (with a particular focus on synchrony). Next, I generalise these results to treat a delayed Wilson-Cowan neural mass model. Moreover, I study arbitrary networks of weakly coupled such nodal units by modifying the phase reduction theory for delay-coupled systems. Finally, I will discuss outstanding challenges for when the coupling is strong and delays are plastic.

    <EventDescription>Identifying the sources of cell-to-cell variability in signaling dynamics is essential to understand drug response variability and develop more effective therapeutics. However, it is challenging because many signaling intermediate reactions are experimentally unobservable. This can be overcome by replacing them with a single random time delay, but the resulting process is non-Markovian, making it difficult to infer cell-to-cell heterogeneity in reaction rates and time delays. In this talk, we present an efficient and scalable moment-based Bayesian method that infers cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the non-Markovian signaling process. We apply this method to single-cell expression profiles from promoters responding to various antibiotics and discovered a major source of cell-to-cell variability in antibiotic stress-signal response: the number of rate-limiting steps in signaling cascades. This knowledge can help identify more effective therapies that destroy all pathogenic or cancer cells.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The most common mathematical model in computational virology is a system of ordinary differential equations. This type of model is used for both in-host models and population level models. Due to an ordinary differential equation model treating the system as a well-mixed system, spatial heterogeneity is not captured in these models. For this reason, agent-based models have grown in popularity because they account for spatial effects. Previous work has shown that ordinary differential equation models and agent-based models can capture the dynamics of the same system, but the parameters from the two separate models are not comparable. This work aims to show how the two sets of parameters can be linked to each other by modeling a system first with a master-equation and then deriving the ordinary differential equation model and agent-based model from the master-equation.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>A major reason for cancer treatment failure and disease progression is the heterogeneous composition of tumor cells at the genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic levels. While tremendous efforts have tried to characterize the makeups of single cells, much less is known about interactions between heterogeneous cancer cells and between cancer cells and the microenvironment in the context of cancer invasion. Clinical studies show that cancer invasion predominantly occurs via collective invasion packs, which invade more aggressively and result in worse outcomes. In vitro non-small cell lung cancer spheroid experiments show that the invasion packs consist of leaders and followers and that leaders and followers engage in mutualistic social interactions during collective invasion. Many fundamental questions remain: What is the division of labor within the heterogeneous invasion pack? How does the leader phenotype emerge? Are phenotypes plastic? How does the invasion pack interact with the stroma? Can the social interaction network be exploited to devise novel treatment strategies? I will present the recent experimental and modeling efforts that try to address these questions. I will try to convince you that analyzing this social interaction network can potentially reveal the ‘weak-links’, which when perturbed can disrupt collective invasion and potentially prevent malignant progression of cancer.

    <EventDescription>Accurate and efficient reduced-order models are essential to understand, predict, estimate, and control complex, multiscale, and nonlinear dynamical systems.  These models should ideally be generalizable, interpretable, and based on limited training data.  This work describes how machine learning may be used to develop accurate and efficient nonlinear dynamical systems models for complex natural and engineered systems.  We explore the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, which identifies a minimal dynamical system model that balances model complexity with accuracy, avoiding overfitting.  This approach tends to promote models that are interpretable and generalizable, capturing the essential “physics” of the system.  We also discuss the importance of learning effective coordinate systems in which the dynamics may be expected to be sparse.  This sparse modeling approach will be demonstrated on a range of challenging modeling problems, for example in fluid dynamics, and we will discuss how to incorporate these models into existing model-based control efforts.

    <EventDescription>In sepsis, the inflammatory response drives organ dysfunction and often results in death. We used four ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to simulate the dynamics of bacteria, the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, and tissue damage, which approximates organism health status. The model was calibrated to experimental data from E. coli infection in genetically identical rats and validated with mortality data for these animals. Typical outcomes included recovery, aseptic death (overwhelming inflammatory response), or septic death (overwhelming bacteria) for a simulated infection when the initial inoculum, pathogen growth rate, local immune response strength, and pro-inflammatory response activation rate were varied. The likelihood of a septic outcome increased with an increase in the initial inoculum of bacteria, an increased pathogen growth rate,  or a decreased host immune response. Results suggested that small changes in parameter values, such as pathogen or immune response parameters, could explain variability in mortality rates seen in the experiments. A sensitivity analysis suggested primary roles for local immune- and bacteria-related terms and lesser roles for global immune response and damage-related terms. Despite successful predictions of mortality, simulated trajectories tended to be clustered closely, suggesting that uncertainty in initial conditions could lead to difficulty in predicting outcomes of sepsis solely using inflammation biomarker levels.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Delay can dramatically affect the dynamics of deterministic and stochastic systems. It can stabilize metastable states for certain stochastic biochemical models that feature positive feedback, for instance. In general, delay interacts subtly with stochasticity. For genetic regulatory networks, delay results from the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational processes associated with the synthesis of regulator proteins. This protein production delay is distributed (random) and operates on the order of minutes. We know that distributed delay can accelerate signaling in feed-forward architectures. Its impact on oscillatory systems, however, remains to be assessed. Here, we show that distributed delay denoises a variety of genetic oscillators, including a degrade-and-fire oscillator, a dual-feedback oscillator, repressilators, and the Kim-Forger model. We identify the universal mechanisms that drive the denoising phenomenon and we use queueing theory to analyze them.

    <EventDescription>The mammalian circadian clock is based on a self-sustaining transcriptional-translational negative feedback loop. This machinery is expected to suffer from the heterogeneous arrival time distribution of clock protein from the noisy intracellular environment at the nucleus; however, mammals exhibit robust daily rhythms of physiological and behavioral processes, including sleep and hormone secretion. We explore under which condition the circadian clock compensates for the heterogeneity by a modeling approach. We show that the spatially-coordinated collective behaviors of protein reduce the heterogeneity in the arrival time distribution at the nucleus, allowing the circadian clock to maintain its rhythm under a wide range of heterogeneity.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Mitochondria convert electron flow to H$^+$ gradients, which in turn produce ATP that powers the chemistry of life. The chemical and structural detail of these processes is known in magnificent and overwhelming detail, but quantitative analysis has proven elusive. The structure concentrates on atoms, molecules and charge, but as any engineer knows, it is the currents that allow manageable analysis. There are too many atoms,  more than $10^{18}$ and interactions, to compute or understand,. The Maxwell equations enforce exact conservation of total current, including the ethereal current $\epsilon_0\partial E/\partial t$ in a trivial but necessary generalization of Kirchhoff’s current law. Huaxiong Huang, Shixin Xu, Zilong Song, and I have combined Kirchhoff’s law with a field theory of chemical reactions to model a key component of the mitochondrion, cytochrome c oxidase. Coupling occurs both on the atomic chemical scale and the macroscopic scale. The coupling depends on the macroscopic structure in which the transporter oxidase is embedded. Coupling is different in the mitochondrion and in voltage clamps because the boundary conditions are different. The Maxwell equations create a component of coupling independent of atomic detail, just as they can couple chemically independent currents through the sodium and potassium channels of the nerve action potential. This coupling is essentially invisible in a structural description that focuses on atoms and neglects current.

    <EventDescription>While different, ion fluxes from either reaction/diffusion or advection/diffusion are important in many fields.  Here, we review a recent analytic solution to the reaction/diffusion equations and how to include finite-sized ions (vs. point ions) in a simple advection/diffusion system.  The reaction/diffusion equations in the excess buffer limit were recently solved analytically for one-dimensional flow from a point source (e.g., flow in a plane or in 3D space from a point source).  This is generalized a numerical algorithm for fast simulations of particle flows from many sources.  For advection/diffusion, we consider nanofluidic slits where ions are driven by either pressure or voltage gradients.  We add the size of ions by coupling classical density functional theory of charged hard sphere fluids in the transverse direction between the slit walls and computing ion flux with the 1D Navier-Stokes equations.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Biological ion channels and synthetic nanopores are responsible for controlled transport of ions through a membrane between two bulk phases. What makes these systems amenable to modeling with reduced models is that they can be viewed as devices. This means that they are tiny machines that provide a stable output signal (ionic currents) if they get a given input signal (voltage or concentration difference). The relation of the input and output parameters are called device functions. Reduced models focus on the physics that produces the device functions (i.e., the physics of how inputs become outputs) rather than the atomic details inside the pore. We present four rules of thumb for constructing good reduced models of ion channels and nanopores. They are about (1) the importance of the axial concentration profiles, (2) the importance of the pore charges, (3) choosing the right explicit degrees of freedom, and (4) creating the proper response functions that replace the implicit degrees of freedom. The art of creating a good reduced model is in distinguishing the important degrees of freedom from the unimportant degrees freedom and to model both domains properly. We show examples for both natural (calcium channels) and synthetic (bipolar) nanopores.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>KcsA is a K channel with four subunits symmetrically arranged around the channel axis. Each subunit has two transmembrane helixes separated by a reentrant Ploop and selectivity filter (SF). SF of KcsA, consisting of a sequence motif (TVGYG), is essential for permeation and selectivity. Four K ion-binding sites exist inside SF, designated S1-S4. In addition, K ion can bind at intracellular/extracellular vestibules of SF designated as S5 and S0 sites. SF is generally too narrow to accommodate a K ion with its hydration shell, and thus must be dehydrated to enter SF. IV curve simulated from classic PNP equations has a serious mismatch with experiment due to the ignorance of steric effect and dehydration. Bikerman-Born-PB model is then used to cure this problem, by which we found in SF K only occupies S0, S2, S3, and S5 leaving S1 and S4 to be void at equilibrium. This is also verified by our MD simulation. The voidness of K at S1 and S4 sites makes these two sites ion-depletion zones, which robustly persist even when voltage is applied, and render Bikerman-Born-PNP model failing to produce any current when voltage is applied. No occupancy at S1 and S4 implies that K ion would jump over these two sites during its permeation through SF, which is not suitable to be modeled by a continuum concept. A reaction rate model was constructed for it with rate constants estimated by all atoms MD energy profiles. The IV curve predicted by our reaction rate model agrees well with experiment.

    <EventDescription>There have been many studies of the instability of a flexible plate or flag to flapping motions, and of large-amplitude flapping. Here we use inviscid simulations and a linearized model to more generally study how key quantities—mode number (or wave number), frequency, and amplitude—depend on the two dimensionless parameters: flag mass and bending stiffness. In the limit of small flag mass, flags perform traveling wave motions that move at nearly the speed of the oncoming flow. The flag mode number scales as the 
-1/4 power of bending stiffness. The flapping frequency has the same scaling, with an additional slight increase with flag mass in the small-mass regime. The flapping amplitude scales approximately as flag mass to the 1/2 power. For large flag mass, the dominant mode number is low (0 or 1), the flapping frequency tends to zero, and the amplitude saturates in the neighborhood of its upper limit (the flag length). In a linearized model, the fastest growing modes have somewhat different power law scalings for wave number and frequency. We discuss how the numerical scalings are consistent with a weakly nonlinear model.

    <EventDescription>Substance use disorders are often viewed mathematically as a social disease, where addictive behaviors are assumed to spread through social contact between individuals. Treating substance use disorders strictly as an infectious disease excludes those who develop this condition in isolation. In this talk, we extend SIS and SIR disease models to the context of substance use disorders by including both contact and non-contact routes into addiction. With the inclusion of non-contact, linear addiction rates, the dynamics of the model fundamentally change so that the addiction-free equilibrium (AFE) and the basic reproductive number no longer exist. To analyze these models, we instead employ techniques from optimal control to determine strategies which minimize substance use disorder in a population where the AFE does not exist.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The metabolic pathways of bacteria can be used in the synthesis of chemical products. Bioengineers are exploring the use of Microcompartments (MCPs), protein structures native to the bacteria which spatially organize the metabolism, to optimize the production of desired products. The relative time scales set by the permeability of the cell membrane, the permeability of the MCP shell, and the reaction kinetics determine if encapsulation can be used to optimize the flux. Estimating the permeability values and kinetic rates is essential to effectively engineer the metabolic pathway.
The system can be described by a set of coupled PDEs with Robin boundary conditions in which only the external boundary states can be measured and the Robin coefficients are the unknown permeabilities of the cell and MCP. Estimating the permeabilities requires solving a high dimensional optimization problem in which most state variables are unmeasured or hidden. We develop a method, informed by the mathematical model and experimental observations, to plot the model manifold in state space and determine which characteristics of the measured states are most sensitive to unknown parameters. The discovered regions of high sensitivity in progress space are used to inform experimental design. This insight is used to reduce the dimension of the observations in the parameter estimation problem, improving computational time for parameter estimation.

    <EventDescription>Bacteriophages ubiquitously shape microbial ecosystems by regulating the abundance, diversity, and activity of the resident bacterial community. The possibility of harnessing phages as control mechanisms for therapeutic applications to the human microbiome has understandably captured the scientific imagination. Despite substantial progress towards this goal in recent years, designing effective phage therapies still requires a better understanding of phage-bacteria interactions at the fundamental level. In particular, effective therapies often require the control of the resident bacterial community rather than its eradication.

We developed an agent-based model of interacting phage and bacteria populations to investigate the coexistence and control mechanisms underlying these dynamics. The model includes the bacteria's growth, division, and dispersal processes. The model is spatially explicit; this aspect is crucial since empirical research shows that the localized growth of bacteria significantly increases their resistance to phages, in contrast to bacteria growing in a well-mixed medium.  Through simulations, we demonstrate the importance of the phage-bacteria interaction network topology and, on the other hand, the choice of phage strategy, invoking `kill the winner' or `arms-race' strategies among others.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Bioimpedance spectroscopy uses the frequency-dependent resistance presented by a biological system to an induced sinusoidal current. Its applications include the analysis of electrochemical biosensors and physiological variables of plants (many of which are relevant to agriculture) and animals (e.g. biomedical).

Equivalent circuit models (ECM) are a long-standing standard tool in bioimpedance spectroscopy. They are effective in modern large-scale or small-scale (in-field or point-of-care) settings where computational resources are limited. ECMs are also efficient feature extractors for regression models.

This presentation concerns two optimization problems relating to ECM:

i) Fitting the circuit parameters to a system's impedance spectrum. The choice of the cost function is important here, as disregarding frequency information by simply using the mean squared error causes the introduction of undesired implicit weighing effects. As for the optimization algorithm itself, we present alternatives to the slow and initial-value-dependent complex non-linear least squares.

ii) Identifying an appropriate equivalent electrical circuit topology for a given electrochemical system using state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, in addition to the incorporation of domain knowledge to ensure adequate interpretability. We take several precautions (specific to bioimpedance spectroscopy) to provide the least complex circuit model capable of generating a given measurement data set.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The endothelial lining of blood vessels presents a large surface area for exchanging materials
between blood and tissues. The endothelial surface layer (ESL) plays a critical role in regulating
vascular permeability, hindering leukocyte adhesion as well as inhibiting coagulation during
inflammation. Once the ESL is pathologically altered, the changes in its topography are believed
to cause vascular hyperpermeability and induce thrombus formation during sepsis. The
occurrence of these biological phenomena requires Red Blood Cells (RBCs) stay within close
proximity to the ESL, initiating RBC-layer interaction. To investigate the influence of various
physical properties of the ESL on the motion of RBCs, we construct two models to represent the
ESL combined with the immersed boundary method. In particular, we focus on analyzing how
lift force and drag force change over time when a RBC is placed close to the ESL as the width,
roughness, and permeability of the ESL vary. Our results suggest that increase in the ESL thickness has a dominant effect in slowing down the motion of RBCs for all physically-relevant permeability values, hindering the migration of RBCs from the layer; whereas effect of the roughness is minimal.

    <EventDescription>Insulin is secreted in pulses by beta-cells located in micro-organs within the pancreas called islets of Langerhans. Somehow the pulsatility is synchronized across the islet population, which consists of hundreds of thousands of islets, even though there is no physical contact among islets. The insulin secreted by beta-cells acts on liver hepatocyte cells to uptake glucose from the blood and the subsequent drop in glucose concentration reduces insulin secretion from beta-cells. One hypothesis is that this closed-loop system is responsible for islet synchronization. In this presentation, we describe our investigation of this synchronization mechanism, combining mathematical modeling with microfluidic experiments. A major focus is the delay between the time that liver cells act to uptake glucose and the time the reduction in glucose concentration is sensed by islets in the pancreas. How does this time delay affect islet synchronization? Can it contribute to the slow ultradian oscillations often observed in measurements of insulin from humans and other mammals?</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Biological and physical systems that can be classified as oscillatory media give rise to interesting phenomena like target patterns and spiral waves. The existence of these structures has been proven in the case of systems with local diffusive interactions. In this talk the more general case of oscillatory media with nonlocal coupling is considered. We model these systems using evolution equations where the nonlocal interactions are expressed via a diffusive convolution kernel, and explore the existence of
rotating wave solutions for these systems.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Transcriptional repression can occur via various mechanisms, such as blocking, sequestration, and displacement. For instance, the repressors can hold the activators to prevent binding with DNA or can bind to the DNA-bound activators to block their transcriptional activity. Although the transcription can be completely suppressed with a single mechanism, multiple repression mechanisms are utilized together to inhibit transcriptional activators in many systems, such as circadian clocks and NF-?B oscillators. This raises the question of what advantages arise if seemingly redundant repression mechanisms are combined. Here, by deriving equations describing the multiple repression mechanisms, we find that their combination can synergistically generate a sharply ultrasensitive transcription response and thus strong oscillations. This rationalizes why the multiple repression mechanisms are used together in various biological oscillators. The critical role of such combined transcriptional repression for strong oscillations is further supported by our analysis of formerly identified mutations disrupting the transcriptional repression of the mammalian circadian clock. The hitherto unrecognized source of the ultrasensitivity, the combined transcriptional repressions, can lead to robust synthetic oscillators with a previously unachievable simple design.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In this talk, I will present an enhanced sampling scheme using the Weighted Ensemble framework aimed at computing current voltage curves from all-atom molecular simulations of narrow ion channels. We show that the method matches brute force simulation of a small, model nanopore. It also matches all-atom K+ currents computed from brute force simulations of KcsA under non-physiologically large voltages, while also efficiently computing currents over a the physiological voltage range. The method becomes more efficient as the flux becomes smaller as when examining selectivity for poorly permeant ions. We discuss how this method can be extended to other systems such as lipid flipping by scramblases and how it can be used to explore forcefield parameterization.

    <EventDescription>The growth, form, and division of membrane-bound vesicles and organelles is a unifying motif across biology. Membranes form the boundaries of the nucleus and cell, organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and vesicles used to transport proteins and other biomolecules. Importantly, these membranes are out-of-equilibrium systems as their lipid constituents are in a state of continual turnover and exchange. Here, we build on a model [Ruiz-Herrero, Fai, and Mahadevan, Dynamics of growth and form in prebiotic vesicles, PRL (2019)] in which vesicle growth is driven purely by physicochemical processes of membrane growth, permeability, and elasticity. We use the immersed boundary method to explore the fluid-structure interaction of growing vesicles. By comparing our simulation results to experiments on fatty acid vesicles, we show how the model captures essential behaviors required of prebiotic vesicles, membraneous bags of fluid of varying components and shapes is hypothesized to have served as the substrate for the origin of life.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The de Rham-Hodge theory is a landmark of the 20$^\text{th}$ Century's mathematics and has had a great impact on mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering. This work introduces an evolutionary de Rham-Hodge method to provide a unified  paradigm for the multiscale geometric and topological analysis of evolving manifolds constructed from a filtration, which induces a family of evolutionary de Rham complexes. While the present method can be easily applied to close manifolds,  the emphasis is given to more challenging compact manifolds with 2-manifold boundaries, which require appropriate analysis and treatment of boundary conditions on differential forms to maintain proper topological properties. Three sets of unique evolutionary Hodge Laplacians are proposed to generate three sets of topology-preserving singular spectra, for which the multiplicities of zero eigenvalues correspond to exactly the persistent Betti numbers of dimensions 0, 1, and 2. Additionally, three sets of non-zero eigenvalues further reveal both topological persistence and geometric progression during the manifold evolution.  Extensive numerical experiments are carried out via the discrete exterior calculus to demonstrate the potential of the proposed paradigm for data representation and shape analysis.  To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, application is considered to the protein B-factor predictions of a few challenging cases for which other existing models do not work well.

    <EventDescription>Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity among patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is associated with increased mortality. In patients with CF, dysglycemia is driven primarily by beta-cell failure and insulin insufficiency due to CF-related disruption of normal pancreatic function. If an individual’s insulin secretion rate (ISR) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is known, the responsivity of beta cells to a metabolic stimulus can be quantified using an established modeling approach. However, ISR cannot be measured directly during an OGTT, so reliable methods for estimating ISR profiles are needed. Since insulin secretion and clearance act on multiple timescales, C-peptide is used as a surrogate for insulin secretion. We employ a differential model of C-peptide dynamics, wherein ISR acts as a forcing function, to infer the statistical distribution of continuous ISR profiles from an individual’s discrete C-peptide data. Additionally, by modeling ISR as a Gaussian process, a closed-form approximation of the ISR profile is obtained from a small number of numerically estimated parameters. This approach provides a detailed characterization of beta-cell responsivity that is more computationally efficient compared to existing methods. We apply this approach to quantify beta-cell dysfunction in a cohort of adolescents with and without CF.

    <EventDescription>The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by a relative failure of insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells to increase insulin concentrations to maintain normal blood glucose concentration. 
Estimation of the secretory capacity of beta-cells is crucial to prevent and intervene in the disease.
Glucose challenge tests have been used to estimate beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity. The product of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity, termed the disposition index (DI), is of great value because it measures beta-cell function relative to insulin requirements. We developed a model disposition index (mDI estimated without insulin, or mDI w/o I) that does not require insulin measurements during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (Ha et al., Diabetes 2021 (70) suppl. 1). To further increase access and refine the assessments of beta-cell function, we adapted our model to calculate a model disposition index using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). CGM has been in the spotlight of diabetes management and has revolutionized the field of medicine as they are approved for glucose monitoring and clinical decision-making in patients with diabetes.

    <EventDescription>The effect of environmental random fluctuations on the growth dynamics of individual animals is not captured by regression models, which commonly used mean growth curves X(t) (animal size at age t) satisfy the ODE dY(t)=b(a-Y(t))dt, where Y(t)=h(X(t)) is a transformed size by a model specific strictly increasing C$^1$ function h. To account for fluctuations, we use the stochastic differential equation models dY(t)=b(a-Y(t))dt+sdW(t), where W(t) is a Wiener process.

These more realistic models can help farmers optimize the profit obtained by raising and selling an animal. To that end, we obtain the profit probability distribution, mean, standard deviation, and other quantities of interest under the more general and realistic market situation where the selling price per kg paid to farmers depends on the animal's age and weight category. We apply results to real weight data of Mertolengo breed cattle males and conclude that farmers are selling the animals before the optimal age, resulting in a lower mean profit. Sensitivity analysis for small changes on model parameter estimates shows that they have a small effect on the optimal expected profit and a negligible effect on the optimal selling age.

    <EventDescription>
In this talk we will use several mathematical tools that allow us to investigate uncertainty in epidemics. We show how these tools can be used to study uncertainty for the COVID-19 pandemic. Mathematical models are based on multiple assumptions and the real-world changes constantly and especially during a pandemic. Some parameters' values vary over the time due to multiple factors including non-pharmaceutical interventions. Forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic has been a very complex problem.  We design and analyze a mathematical model based on a system of stochastic differential equations, to get deeper insight about the complexity of COVID-19 pandemic forecasting. The results provide useful information regarding the difficulties that many studies have faced to forecast the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find the basic reproduction number for the stochastic model that is a crucial threshold parameter to understand the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and provide some ideas regarding the modeling of uncertainty in a pandemic.

    <EventDescription>The hormone melatonin, which is cyclically produced in the pineal gland, promotes sleep propensity and interacts bidirectionally with the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Melatonin supplements are regularly used to induce sleep and shift individuals’ circadian phase. To understand the phase shifting impact of exogenous melatonin we have developed a combined model of the SCN network and melatonin pharmacokinetics. This work builds off a prior mathematical model that explains how the large-scale oscillatory phenomenon of the pacemaker arises from the connections of many oscillators within the SCN. Pharmacokinetic interactions modeled in other work have been adapted to this network model. The parameters corresponding to the melatonin phase response curve (PRC) of individual cells within the SCN were estimated by fitting data from experiments measuring the phase response to 3.0 mg and 0.5 mg exogenous doses of melatonin. Thus, the model describes the direct impact of blood plasma melatonin on clock regulation. This generalizes to other melatonin dosing schemes and predicts the associated phase shifts. This framework can also be applied to investigate the interaction between the acute sleep promoting and phase shifting properties of melatonin.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a serious illness in which major arteries become occluded, causing reduced blood flow to peripheral tissues. Developing improved treatment strategies for PAD requires a more complete understanding of the vascular changes that occur both proximal and distal to the site of occlusion.  Mathematical modeling provides a useful tool to predict the role of collateral arteries in flow compensation following occlusion.  In this work, a vascular wall mechanics model is used to simulate acute and chronic vascular adaptations in the collateral arteries and collateral-dependent arterioles of the rat hindlimb. On an acute timeframe, the vascular tone of collateral arteries and distal arterioles is determined by responses to pressure, shear stress, and metabolic demand. On a chronic timeframe, arteriogenesis (outward vessel remodeling) is modeled by increased passive vessel diameter, and angiogenesis (growth of new capillaries) is assumed to depend on venous oxygen saturation levels. The model predicts that acute responses only restore post-occlusion flow to 24\% of non-occluded blood flow, while the addition of chronic responses (structural adaptation) yields blood flow that is 84\% of the non-occluded level. Ultimately, the model predictions indicate that interventions which enhance collateral arteriogenesis would have the greatest potential for restoring blood flow to healthy levels.

    <EventDescription>Ecosystems can be described at two well-differentiated levels: the microscale (e.g., growth rates of individuals) and the macroscale (e.g., ecosystem productivity).  In steady state, probability distributions over the microscale variables are predicted from knowledge of the static macroscale state variables using the maximum information entropy inference procedure (MaxEnt).  If the state variables are changing in time, however, as in a disturbed ecosystem, the constraints imposed by instantaneous values of the dynamic state variables fail to accurately predict instantaneous microscale distributions.  The dynamics of two-tiered systems are especially complex if the macroscale variables both influence the dynamics of the microscale variables and are sums or averages over them.  I present a hybrid, mechanism-plus-MaxEnt, theory to describe the dynamics of such systems.  A toy model illustrates general concepts and generates many of the rich behaviors emerging from the theory.

    <EventDescription>Mathematical ecology has a long and successful history of modeling
negative interactions between organisms, such as competition and
predation.  Modeling mutualisms, where members of different species
provide benefits to each other, is much more difficult.  Simple models
based on differential equations have a tendency to be highly unstable,
and fixing this requires looking more deeply into the mechanisms by
which benefits are shared.  I present a model of interactions between
plants, pathogens, and fungal mutualists that builds on careful
consideration of resource allocation.  This mutualism, like most others,
is context-dependent, meaning that interaction becomes negative in
certain environments, and thus interacts with pathogens to shape plant
diversity.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Pituitary hormones are secreted by five families of endocrine cells. These cells are electrically active, and hormone secretion occurs when the cells produce bursts of electrical impulses. Although most of what is known about pituitary cell biophysics comes from studies of dispersed cells, in the physiological environment cells of each type form networks, where gap junctions electrically couple one cell to its neighbors. Such “structural networks” give rise to “functional networks” in which cells whose activity is synchronized are considered to be neighbors. While the determination of structural networks of pituitary cells is technically very difficult, determination of functional networks is more tractable, using calcium fluorescence in pituitary slices. Such studies have demonstrated that the functional networks are scale-free, with a power-law degree distribution, characterized by a few high-degree hubs and many low-degree nodes. In this presentation, we use mathematical models of scale-free structural pituitary cell networks to determine what the functional network properties tell us about the structural network. We address several questions: Are the hubs of functional (structural) networks also hubs of the structural (functional) networks? To what extent is it possible to construct a structural network using data from a functional network? How does the giant component of synchronized cells decay as cells are systematically or randomly silenced or eliminated?

    <EventDescription>Description: Multicomponent amphiphilic systems containing oil, water, and surfactants have been widely utilized in applications ranging from oil recovery and drug delivery to artificial cells and membranes. Here, surfactant self-assemblies at the water-oil interface have been used to develop a new liquid-in-liquid 3D printing technique to fabricate aqueous constructs by injecting the continuous tubules of aqueous solutions within a polar oil phase. The photopolymerization of these printed liquid constructs render them mechanically robust and lock in the shape of printed constructs. SAXS measurements confirm the presence of nanostructures (HEX and LAM morphology) within the cured printed constructs. Tensile tests revealed that printed constructs are mechanically robust and can be tuned by changing the composition of aqueous solutions. The work presented here has implications in a wide variety of complex fluid systems, including surfactant mixtures, polymer solutions, emulsions, and colloidal domains.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) often render a potential for global spread. This problem is likely exacerbated by the explosive growth of international transportation, especially air travel. Although their effectiveness is debatable, long-term travel restrictions can lead to enormous socio-economic burdens and likely mental health sequelae. Here, based on existing literature and gained knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic, we develop a metapopulation model framework to evaluate the impact of travel policies between populations, involving testing and quarantine. Within this framework, we consider a leaky quarantine with a fixed duration, after which a fraction of the exposed or infectious travellers enter the population. We explore how the peak of incidence and the time of 0.1\% prevalence respond to the dispersal rate, the true-positive rate of testing of the exposed and the infected individuals, and the duration of quarantine following travels.

    <EventDescription>While blood clot formation has been relatively well studied, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the subsequent structural and mechanical clot remodeling called contraction or retraction. Impairment of the clot contraction process is associated with both life-threatening bleeding and thrombotic conditions, such as ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism, and others. Recently, blood clot contraction was observed to be hindered in patients with COVID-19. A novel three-dimensional multiscale computational model is developed and used to quantify biomechanical mechanisms of the kinetics of clot contraction driven by platelet-fibrin pulling interactions. These results provide novel biological insights since filopodia have been thought of previously as performing mostly a sensory function. The biomechanical mechanisms and modeling approach described can potentially apply to studying other blood clotting processes as well as to other systems in which cells are embedded in a filamentous network and exert forces on the extracellular matrix modulated by the substrate stiffness.

    <EventDescription>There are currently seven commonly used mathematical models that describe how cancer replicates. Comparison of these model predictions to experimental data has so far failed to determine which model is the most accurate, although it is well-known that the different models can result in vastly different predictions of how the cancer grows. There is growing interest in using mathematical models to help predict the efficacy of chemotherapy, so it is crucial that we understand how the underlying choice of cancer growth model affects estimates of treatment effectiveness. In this study, we generate synthetic treatment data using each of the growth models and fit the data sets using the other growth models to determine the robustness of efficacy parameter estimates. We find that chemotherapy efficacy parameters are fairly insensitive to the choice of cancer growth model, offering hope that mathematical models can be used to help predict chemotherapy outcomes.

    <EventDescription>We developed a mathematical model for autologous stem cell gene therapies to cure sickle cell disease by transplanting stem cells containing a curative gene. Successful transplantation is expected to produce a lifelong supply of red blood cells (RBCs) containing an anti-sickling hemoglobin. There is limited patient data available from early clinical trials for this complex multi-step therapy. We set out to quantify the impact of key treatment parameters, such as initial stem cell dose, efficiency of lentiviral transduction, and degree of bone marrow preconditioning on engraftment efficiency, peripheral RBC numbers, and anti-sickling hemoglobin levels.
Using ODEs we modeled erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, and hemoglobin assembly within RBC. Model simulations match observed RBC and hemoglobin levels in healthy and SCD phenotypes. Treatment simulations predict stem cell engraftment and RBC dynamics. Post-treatment dynamics show an early phase of reconstitution due to short lived stem cells, followed by a sustained RBC production from stable engraftment of long-term stem cells as previously reported. Using local sensitivity analysis, the initial dose of transduced stem cells and the intensity of bone marrow preconditioning are predicted to most positively impact long-term outcomes. The quantitative systems pharmacology approach used here demonstrates the value of model-assisted therapeutic design for gene therapies.

    <EventDescription>The analysis of electrical impulse phenomena in cardiac muscle tissue
is important for the diagnosis of heart rhythm disorders and other cardiac
pathophysiology. Cardiac mapping techniques acquire time-series and
combine them to visualize the spread of nonlinear waves of electrical
excitation in the heart. However, low spatial resolution, sparse
measurement locations, noise, and other artifacts make it challenging to
accurately visualize spatio-temporal activity. Here, we demonstrate that
deep learning can be used to compute phase maps and detect phase
singularities in optical mapping videos of ventricular fibrillation, as well as
in very noisy, low-resolution, and extremely sparse simulated data of
reentrant wave chaos mimicking catheter mapping data. Rather than
encoding a phase signal from time-series data, a convolutional neural
network (CNN) instead learns to directly associate phase maps and phase
singularities with short spatio-temporal sequences of electrical data.
Predictions can be performed across different data, with models being
trained on one species and then successfully applied to another, or being
trained on simulated data and then applied to experimental data. Neural
networks are a promising alternative to conventional phase mapping and
rotor core localization methods. Future uses may include the analysis of
optical mapping studies in basic cardiovascular research, as well as the
mapping of atrial fibrillation in the clinical setting.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Recent clinical studies have shown that subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT) is a common finding after a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and if left untreated, SLT can lead to serious complications. Models are needed to determine the underlying cause of SLT and to predict which patients will develop SLT. To this end, we develop a model of aortic stenosis that combines fluid-structure interaction and a continuum thrombosis model that allows for deposition along the moving leaflets. The build-up of material on the leaflets in turn increase the stiffness of the leaflets. We quantify the model's ability to realize changes in stroke volume and pressures, and discuss improvements to model growth of a thrombus on a moving surface. These new approaches represent an important advancement in thrombosis modeling. Additionally, the techniques developed herein can be adapted to model deposition or absorption along other moving boundaries, such as drug absorption in the gut or particulate deposition in the lungs.

    <EventDescription>Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder which causes patients to experience both acute and chronic pain. Recent work has sought to use modern mobile or wearable technology to monitor and model patient pain and vital signs over time. Here, we develop and test various methods for partitioning irregularly and sparsely sampled histories of pain over time into distinct groups, seeking also to rigorously examine the consistency of the clustering methodology. In this work, we use self-reported pain data from mobile apps and electronic hospital records to examine patient pain experiences. We use network-based unsupervised learning methods to identify underlying groups of pain trajectories (i.e., reported pain values over time). Our results indicate that patients' experiences fall generally into three classes---those with low pain, those with persistent high levels of chronic pain, and those who generally have moderate pain which varies greatly day to day. The results of this work have the potential to help both doctors and patients better categorize and manage pain levels over time. Further, the methods we develop and apply may be useful in any application where data is sparsely and irregularly sampled.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>We study the induction and stabilization of spiral structures for 
the cyclic three-species stochastic May–Leonard model with asymmetric 
predation rates on a spatially inhomogeneous two-dimensional toroidal 
lattice using Monte Carlo simulations. In an isolated setting, 
strongly asymmetric predation rates lead to rapid extinction from 
coexistence of all three species to a single surviving population. 
However, when the asymmetric competing system is coupled via diffusive
proliferation to a fully symmetric May–Leonard patch, the stable 
spiral patterns from this region induce transient plane-wave fronts 
and ultimately quasi-stationary spiral patterns in the vulnerable 
asymmetric region. Thus, the endangered ecological subsystem may 
effectively become stabilized through immigration from a smaller 
stable region. To describe the stabilization of spiral population 
structures in the asymmetric region, we compare the increase in the 
robustness of these topological defects at extreme values of the 
asymmetric predation rates in the spatially coupled system with the 
corresponding asymmetric May–Leonard model in isolation. We delineate 
the quasi-stationary nature of coexistence induced in the asymmetric 
subsystem by its diffusive coupling to a symmetric May–Leonard patch, 
and propose a (semi-)quantitative criterion for the spiral 
oscillations to be sustained in the asymmetric region.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Despite (i) overlapping acoustic patterns of phonemes, (ii) boundaries that shift with speaking rate, talker characteristics, phonetic context, coarticulation, and novelty of message, and (iii) a many-to-many mapping between acoustics and precepts, listeners generally achieve phonetic constancy and understand speech.  Relatively simple cognitive models have guided theories of the time course of human spoken word recognition (HSR) for decades, but generally have small vocabularies, do not use real speech as input, and set aside the problem of learning. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems provide robust, real-world computer speech recognition, but often contain many layers of richly connected neurons (making introspection difficult) and require carefully engineered training regimens and architectures that are not typically constrained by biological considerations. I will discuss efforts by myself and my collaborators to partially bridge this gap with the EARSHOT model: a shallow neural network model which can learn to map real speech from multiple talkers to semantic targets with high accuracy, with a human-like time course of lexical access and phonological competition. Analysis of the model’s internal representations and tests on secondary tasks suggest that the model develops a distributed phonological code despite no explicit training on phonetic or phonemic targets. The ability to work with real speech is a major advance for cognitive models of HSR. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Recent experimental studies indicated the existence of intrinsic control of axonal length by neurons. A possible underlying mechanism relies on mutual delayed feedback between two oscillatory signals, which are transport by molecular motors in an axon. However, many aspects of this mechanism remain unexplored. As a theoretical investigation, we propose a delayed feedback model built on existing theoretical studies and connect it to motor dynamics. Bifurcation analysis on the model indicates that the oscillation inhibits axonal growth and the inhibition becomes stronger as the oscillation period increases. We then provide a generic signaling pathway to illustrate how a neuron can decode the length information from the oscillatory signals and use it to control its axonal length. The pathway and the delayed feedback model form a closed loop system, which predicts step-like changes in axonal length that can be linked to the initiation/termination of the oscillation. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Before advancing to clinical trials, new drugs are screened for their proarrhythmic potential using a method that is overly conservative and provides limited mechanistic insight. The shortcomings of this approach can lead to the misclassification of beneficial drugs as proarrhythmic. We developed an in silico-in vitro pipeline using mathematical models and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to circumvent this problem. A computational iPSC-CM model was used with a genetic algorithm to design experiments, specifically electrophysiological voltage-clamp (VC) protocols to identify which of several cardiac ion channels were blocked during in vitro drug studies. Such VC data, along with dynamically clamped action potentials (AP), were acquired from iPSC-CMs before and after treatment with a control solution or a low- (verapamil), intermediate- (cisapride), or high-risk (quinidine or quinine) drug. We identified significant AP prolongation (a marker of proarrhythmia) in response to both high-risk drugs and, from the VC data, determined ion channel targets that were likely responsible for these AP changes. In summary, we developed an in silico-in vitro pipeline that simultaneously identified proarrhythmia risk and underlying mechanism for cardiac ion channel-blocking drugs, illustrating the pipeline’s value in the preclinical drug screening phase.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>As experimentally characterizing all underlying kinetics of reactions in biochemical systems is almost impossible, their combined effects have frequently been described by simplified non-elementary reaction functions for over a century. Recently, the deterministically driven non-elementary reaction functions have been heuristically used for stochastic simulations with the Gillespie algorithm. While this approach has been one of the most popular methods for efficient stochastic simulations, its validity condition has remained poorly understood. In this presentation, we derive a complete condition under which this approach can accurately capture the stochastic dynamics of reversible binding, the critical reaction to describe nearly all biochemical systems such as gene regulation and enzyme catalysis. Furthermore, we suggest alternative simplified reaction functions for stochastic reversible binding. This provides a universally valid framework for the simplification of stochastic biochemical systems with rapid reversible bindings. To facilitate the framework, we provide a computational package, ASSISTER, that performs the present framework automatically.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) are complex oscillatory behaviors of multiple-timescale dynamical systems in which there is an alternation of large-amplitude and small-amplitude oscillations. It is well known that MMOs in two-timescale systems arise either from a canard mechanism associated with a folded node singularity or a delayed Andronov-Hopf bifurcation (DHB) of the fast subsystem. While MMOs in two-timescale systems have been extensively studied, less is known regarding MMOs emerging in three-timescale systems. In this work, we examine the mechanisms of MMOs in a coupled Morris-Lecar model neurons with three timescales. Define the critical manifold $M_{s}$ as the set of equilibria of the fast subsystem consisting of equations for fast variables. The reduced problem on $M_{s}$ is itself a slow-superslow system exhibiting its own critical manifold $M_{ss}$. We show that when the upper fold surface $L_{s}$ of $M_{s}$ intersects $M_{ss}$, the canard and DHB mechanisms can coexist and interact to produce a type of MMOs that exhibits properties of both mechanisms and is robust to changes of parameters that control timescales. Decreasing the strength of the coupling from one neuron to another neuron can shift the upper $L_{s}$ and $M_{ss}$ so they no longer intersect. As a result, there is only one mechanism contributing to MMOs and the resulting MMOs appear to be less robust than MMOs arising in the first scenario.

    <EventDescription>Utilizing experimental data, a mathematical model is developed to study the persistence of plasmid carriers after their introduction into the bacterial community of the mouse gastrointestinal tract. The model includes the interplay between the plasmid-carrying donor bacteria, the established resident bacteria, and the nutrient concentration of the system. The subsequent system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is interpreted analytically and numerically. Mathematical conditions for effective persistence of the plasmid-carrying bacterial population are derived, which can be adopted to introduce a plasmid to the murine gut microbiome. Furthermore, numerical simulations are incorporated to corroborate the theoretical results, compare to the experimental results, and explore dosing strategies.	</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Currently, pregnancy complications are detected after it is too late to turn the course of the pregnancy. This is because imaging of the fetus is ineffective using ultrasounds and no model effectively predicts adverse pregnancy outcomes based on placental ultrasound images. Nevertheless, ultrasounds have been deemed effective in imaging circular objects such as the placenta. Given ultrasound compatibility with the placenta and the modern correlation of fetal growth restriction with pregnancy complications, the Verhulst model was developed to track placental growth. This model exhibits placental volume as a function of time. The solution of the Verhulst model contains an inflection point. This inflection point could potentially give insight into the outcome of a pregnancy. I will use past pregnancy data to fit and analyze this model along with the resultant inflection points and will present my results. This information has a high potential to allow for early opportunities to predict adverse fetal-maternal outcomes.

    <EventDescription>The mitotic spindle is a highly regulated biophysical machine composed of microtubules (MTs), crosslinking proteins, and motor proteins. A balance of forces generated by these components on and within the spindle is required for efficient and error-free cell division. This becomes particularly relevant in cancer contexts where supernumerary centrosomes are present and spindle structure is disrupted. In this case, forces drive centrosomes to cluster together to form a pseudo-bipolar spindle, allowing the cell to undergo a bipolar division and remain proliferative. We define a computational force-balance model to recapitulate spindle formation and maintenance in cells with two or more than two centrosomes. Our model implicates the motor protein dynein in the regulation of bipolar spindle length in a cell context with two centrosomes, which we confirm experimentally using fixed and live-cell imaging approaches. In vivo manipulations support our model prediction, showing both a decrease in steady-state spindle length and a reduction in spindle length fluctuations in the absence of cortical dynein activity. Furthermore, disruption of cortical dynein activity in cells with supernumerary centrosomes compromises the ability of centrosomes to cluster. These results reveal new roles of cortical dynein in the regulation of spindle length and centrosome clustering during mitotic progression.

    <EventDescription>About one in ten Americans wears contact lenses. The main reasons individuals stop using contact lenses are discomfort and dryness. To understand what makes contact lenses comfortable or not, it is essential to understand the interaction between the contact lens and the eye. We propose a mathematical model of the interaction between the contact lens and the eye that accounts for the deformability of the eye. The lens is modeled as a thin, axially symmetric, soft hydrogel contact lens that conforms to the eye shape. The eye is model as a homogenous, isotropic, axially symmetric, linear elastic material. The eye and the lens are coupled via the non-linear suction pressure under the lens. The model is used to investigate the effect of eye deformability on the lens’ suction pressure by comparison to the rigid eye case for different lens shapes.

    <EventDescription>From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers assessed the impact of the disease in terms of loss of life, medical load, economic damage, and other key metrics of resiliency and consequence mitigation. These studies included estimates of transmissibility, viral survivability, and other components of a disease transmission model at different levels of fidelity, resulting in analyses that were informative but, in many ways, incomplete. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we present a robust modeling framework that considers disease transmissibility from the source (characterization of the initial environment) through transport and dispersion (the effect the environment has on the initial source), and infectivity and severity (the effect that the presented environment has on the susceptible individual). The framework is designed to work across a range of particle sizes (from sub-micron up to 100 micron) and estimates the generation, environmental fate, deposited dose, and infection/severity, allowing for end-to-end analysis that can be transitioned to individual and population health models. Ultimately, we demonstrate how such high-fidelity models of disease transmission can advance and prioritize research efforts by conducting numerical simulations within this framework.

    <EventDescription>Thus far immunotherapy has had limited impact on ovarian cancer. Vigil (a novel DNA-based multifunctional immune-therapeutic) has shown clinical benefit to prolong relapse-free survival and overall survival in the BRCA wild type and HRP populations. We further analyzed molecular signals related to sensitivity of Vigil treatment. Tissue from patients enrolled in the randomized double-blind trial of Vigil vs. placebo as maintenance in frontline management of advanced resectable ovarian cancer underwent DNA polymorphism analysis. Data was generated from a 981 gene panel to determine the tumor mutation burden and classify variants using Ingenuity Variant Analysis software or NIH ClinVar. STRING application was used to create a protein-protein interaction network. Topological distance and probability of co-mutation were used to calculate the C-score and cumulative C-score. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to determine the relationship between gene pairs with a high cumC-score and clinical parameters. Improved relapse free survival in Vigil treated patients was found for the TP53m-BRCAwt-HRP group compared to placebo. Results suggest a subset of ovarian cancer patients with enhanced susceptibility to Vigil immunotherapy. The hypothesis-generating data presented invites a validation study of Vigil in target identified populations and supports clinical consideration of STRING-generated network application to biomarker characterization with other cancer patients targeted with Vigil.

    <EventDescription>Phase reduction techniques have been used to make complex oscillatory systems tractable by approximating them with systems of pairwise coupled (one-dimensional) phase oscillators [Pietras, Daffertshofer (2019)]. Recent advances show that three- and fourway interactions naturally appear in phase reductions of coupled oscillatory systems [Ashwin, Rodrigues (2016)]. Networks of coupled oscillators can exhibit undesired collective behaviour such as (partial) synchronisation. Methods to control the collective behaviour of oscillatory networks are usually limited to controlling pairwise phase interactions. We generalised pairwise synchronisation engineering [Kiss, Rusin, Kori, Hudson (2007)] to account for the higher order interactions. We design a time-delayed feedback and use gain and delay parameters to match the phase reduction of a network of arbitrary oscillators to a phase model that has the desired behaviour. Examples of applications could be controlling neuronal oscillators in the treatment of Parkinsons disease and epileptic seizures.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The Koopman operator paradigm can be leveraged to infer a general, non-linear dynamical models and obtain its input-to-output relations using an asymptotic expansion in the isostable coordinate basis. These isostable coordinates capture the dynamics associated with the slowest decaying Koopman eigenmodes. However, direct calculation of these input-to-output relations using this strategy requires knowledge of the underlying model equations. In this presentation, a strategy is considered to compute these isostable-coordinate-based models in a data-driven manner using neural networks whose layers are based on the asymptotically expanded input-to-output isostable coordinate relationships. A set of perturbations is applied to the dynamical system and these inputs along with the corresponding outputs are fed to the neural networks for supervised training to obtain the resulting model. For complex valued isostable coordinates, a transformation is derived that relies on complex conjugacy to ensure that the neural network weights remain real. This strategy is implemented and illustrated to capture dynamical behaviors associated with a population of coupled neural oscillators.

    <EventDescription>\textit{Chlamydia trachomatics (C. trachomatics)} is a major cause of bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States and is associated with adverse outcomes in the upper genital tract of women. It is unclear why some women are more likely to develop asymptomatic infection, have severe infection, or stay uninfected after exposure to \textit{C. trachomatics}. Prior studies have shown a relationship between vaginal microbial composition and susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections including Chlamydia. However, little is known about the microbiome dynamics, especially in the upper genital tract, and its association with Chlamydia infection. We use mice as a model organism, seek to elucidate the association of genital tract microbiome dynamics with Chlamydia infection, and determining whether the time of infection affects the genital tract microbiome over time via analyzing the data collected before and over the course of infection.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cardiac electrophysiological (CEP) action potential cell models have been enormously successful as a scientific tool to develop and test mechanistic hypotheses. CEP models are now being used in safety-critical clinical applications which require rigorous validation and credibility assessment for their context of use. Incorporating experimental uncertainty in cell simulations results in a variety of action potential behavior including: normal repolarization (NR) and abnormal oscillations and/or failure to repolarize. How this cellular uncertainty affects action potential spatial heterogeneity and behavior in tissue is unknown but very important. Here simulations are used to study the impact of cellular coupling. Uncertainty data was extracted from 16 studies and incorporated into all repolarization parameters in the context of 8 transmembrane current sub-models. The method of pooled variance was used to incorporate uncertainty from multiple studies. In control cells (C ), 26\% exhibited abnormal behavior and this number increased to 71\% when an important potassium current was blocked (B). Results from one- and two-dimensional simulations for both C and B will be presented in which the coupling strength is varied. Surprisingly the cellular abnormalities that occur when experimental data uncertainty is incorporated into simulations does NOT translate into unphysiological behavior in simulations in tissue for both C and B.

    <EventDescription>Protein interaction hot spots contribute disproportionately to the binding free energy of a protein-protein complex. In this work, we demonstrate that evolutionary signatures at putative hot spots are a strong indictor of natively bound protein-protein interfaces. We also present a study of feature analysis for our KFC hot spot algorithm, highlighting how combinatorial study of machine learning features adds insight into the dominant physiochemical properties of hot spots.

    <EventDescription>The neuronal mechanisms of various cognitive functions have been linked to metastable dynamics of recurrent neural networks. Metastability, such as population spikes or spontaneous transitions between up- and down-states, may result from slow fatigue processes (e.g., short-term depression of presynaptic synapses), from noisy fluctuations, or from an interplay of both. Previous modeling studies that consider either detailed spiking neuron networks, or heuristic firing rate models, have not provided satisfactory mechanistic insights how single neuron dynamics and finite-size fluctuations contribute to metastable population activity. In this talk, we will propose a mesoscopic description for networks of spiking neurons with short-term depression that is based on a rigorous reduction from microscopic neuron dynamics. With this novel mesoscopic model, we investigate typical examples of metastable network dynamics and also shed new light on hippocampal replay.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In this contributed talk, we study a class of randomized logistic models with harvesting using the so called Random Differential Equations approach. We propose a full randomization of this relevant ecological model by assuming that the per capita rate, the carrying capacity and the initial condition are random variables. In contrast, the harvesting intensity is assumed to be a parametric stochastic process representing different types of capture. We obtain semi-explicit expressions for the probability density function of the solution, which is a stochastic process. This finding is done under very general hypotheses that permit treating a wide range of probability distributions. This is a key issue from a practical standpoint since it provides more flexibility when applying Inverse Uncertainty Quantification Techniques to set adequate probability distributions to each model parameter so that the model's response can capture uncertainties in simple data. We finally illustrate all the theoretical results by means of a variety of numerical simulations and an application using real world data.

    <EventDescription>For cells to divide, they must undergo the process of mitosis: the spatial organization of their copied genetic material to precise locations. This task is done with surprising speed and accuracy, but the underlying microscopic molecular mechanisms are difficult to observe or disentangle. Instead, we take a data-driven approach by using macroscopic trajectory data to statistically learn dynamical interactions that drive the underlying motion. To explain these emergent interactions, we consider mechanistic models of the mitotic spindle describing various microtubule geometries and forces from molecular motors. By learning models directly from the data, we deduce possible microscopic mechanisms of how chromosomes are gathered to the spindle from their macroscopic movement. This work is in collaboration with Alex Mogilner (NYU) and the lab of Alexey Khodjakov (Wadsworth Center, NY State Dept of Health).</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In outbreaks, studying host heterogeneity based on demographic and/or environmental factors is critical to understanding the spread of infectious diseases. We will explore a base ordinary differential equation model, then incorporate heterogeneity through stochastic models formulated as a time-nonhomogeneous stochastic process (NHP) model with discrete random variables and a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with continuous random variables.

    <EventDescription>Periodic gene expression dynamics are key to cell and organism physiology. Studies of oscillatory expression have focused on networks with intuitive regulatory negative feedback loops, leaving unknown whether other common biochemical reactions can produce oscillations. Oscillation and noise have been proposed to support the capacity of mammalian progenitor cells to restore heterogenous, multimodal expression from extreme subpopulations, but underlying networks and specific roles of noise remained elusive. We use mass-action-based models to show that regulated RNA degradation involving as few as two RNAs, applicable to nearly half of human protein-coding genes, can generate sustained oscillations without imposed feedback. Diverging oscillation periods synergize with noise to robustly restore cell bimodal gene expression in cell populations. The global bifurcation organizing this divergence relies on an oscillator and bistable switch which cannot be decomposed into two structural modules. Our work reveals surprisingly rich dynamics of post-transcriptional reactions and a potentially widespread mechanism useful for development and regeneration.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model plays an important role in simulating nanopore and ion channel systems. In nanopore simulations, the large-size nanopore system and convection-dominated Nernst-Planck (NP) equations will bring convergence difficulties. Therefore, we propose an improved finite element method (FEM) with an inverse averaging technique to solve the three-dimensional PNP model, named inverse averaging FEM (IAFEM). First, the Slotboom variables are introduced to transform the non-symmetric NP equations into self-adjoint 2nd-order elliptic equations with exponentially behaved coefficients. Then, these  coefficients are approximated with their harmonic averages calculated with an inverse averaging technique on every tetrahedral element edge. Our scheme shows good convergence when simulating single or porous nanopore systems, and it is stable for convection-dominated NP equations. Our method also guarantees conservation of currents, which some other stabilization schemes do not possess. Our numerical experiments on benchmark problems verify the scheme's accuracy and robustness, and the method performs better than the standard FEM for convection-dominated problems. A simulation of realistic chemical experiments is presented to illustrate that the IAFEM is effective for three-dimensional interconnected nanopores, ion channel, and semiconductor devices.

    <EventDescription>Many cells in the body experience cyclic mechanical loading, which can impact cellular processes and morphology. In vitro studies often report that cells reorient in response to cyclic stretch of their substrate. To explore cellular mechanisms involved in this reorientation, a computational model was developed by adapting a previously developed model of the actin–myosin–integrin motor-clutch system. The model predicts that under most conditions, actin bundles align perpendicular to the direction of applied cyclic stretch, but under specific conditions, such as low substrate stiffness, actin bundles align parallel to the direction of stretch. The model also predicts that stretch frequency impacts the rate of reorientation and that proper myosin function is critical in the reorientation response. These predictions are consistent with reports from the literature and new experimental results. The model suggests that the impact of different stretching conditions on the direction of cell alignment can largely be understood by considering their impact on cell–substrate detachment events, specifically whether detachments preferentially occur during stretching or relaxing of the substrate.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cell-type deconvolution of bulk tissue RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data is an important step towards understanding the variations in cell-type composition among disease conditions. Various deconvolution methods have been developed.  However, the performance of existing methods heavily relies on the quality of information provided by external data sources, such as the selection of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data as a reference and prior biological information. We present the Integrated and Robust Deconvolution (InteRD) algorithm to infer cell-type proportions from target bulk RNA-seq data. Owing to the innovative use of penalized regression with a new evaluation criterion for deconvolution, InteRD has three primary advantages. First, it is able to effectively integrate deconvolution results from multiple scRNA-seq datasets. Second, InteRD calibrates estimates from reference-based deconvolution by taking into account extra biological information as priors. Third, the proposed algorithm is equipped with a data-driven mechanism of self-control designed to be robust to the introduction of inaccurate information in the deconvolution system. Benchmark evaluations show that InteRD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further applied InteRD to a human pancreatic islet dataset and a human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dataset; the results from InteRD agreed well with known biological facts.

    <EventDescription>Effective molecular representations are of key importance to the success of machine learning models in biomolecular data analysis. The advent of TDA has brought about a series of TDA-based machine learning models in drug design. In this talk, we will introduce a series of new persistent functions, in particular, persistent Ollivier Ricci curvature, persistent Forman Ricci curvature and persistent spectral models. Each of these persistent functions when computed under a filtration-induced persistent process results in an array of feature vectors derived from topological or geometrical invariants such as spectral eigenvalues and Ricci curvatures. The features are then inputs to deep learning and ensemble learning models which comprises of gradient boosting trees and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our persistent Ricci curvature based molecular representations have been extensively trained and tested on three most commonly-used datasets, including PDBbind-2007, PDBbind-2013 and PDBbind-2016.

    <EventDescription>Mathematical models of cancer growth and treatment are used to hypothesize answers to open questions, including what individual characteristics may lead to non-uniform patient responses to treatments, and how to optimize and personalize therapy strategies.  Mathematical models can help to provide insights into the mechanisms that influence patient responses, and can occasionally lead to surprising outcomes. When multiple and sometimes conflicting goals are in play (such as aiming to kill as many tumor cells as possible while keeping the immune response as strong as possible), mathematical modeling can help to determine how to find balance in treatment approaches. In this talk, we will present a sample of simple mathematical models created to answer questions about chemotherapy, immunotherapy, combination therapy, and oncolytic virus therapy. These models are used to simulate disease dynamics with treatment interventions, and to look for the balance in treatment approaches that may slow, or even stop, disease progression.

    <EventDescription>Metachronal waves are ubiquitous in propulsive and fluid transport systems across many different scales and morphologies in the biological world. Tomopterids are a soft-bodied, holopelagic worm that use metachrony with their flexible, gelatinous parapodia to deftly navigate the midwater ocean column that they inhabit. In the following study, we develop a three-dimensional, fluid–structure interaction model of a tomopterid parapodium to explore the emergent metachronal waves formed from the interplay of passive body elasticity, active muscular tension, and hydrodynamic forces. After introducing our model, we examine the effects that varying material properties have on the stroke of an individual parapodium. We then explore the temporal dynamics when multiple parapodia are placed sequentially and how differences in the phase can alter the collective kinematics and resulting flow field.

    <EventDescription>The therapeutic efficacy of cancer cell surface targeting antibodies can be affected by shedding of target cancer cell surface molecules which can escape targeted treatment by lowering the expression of target but also producing soluble targets that reduce the levels of free drug. The net effect of target shedding on drug efficacy is a complex interplay of several dynamical processes: a) the kinetics of drug action in lysis and hence removal of source of soluble targets, b) the drug pharmacokinetics, and c) the feedback loops that can dynamically affect target shedding rates. We investigate this interplay between drug and target using mechanistic mathematical models for both liquid and solid tumors. We showcase our modeling framework and analysis of the resulting dynamical system which explicitly tracks the distribution of the drug, the interaction of the drug with shed targets, the modulation of shedding by the drug, and the lysis of tumor cells in the presence of free drug. We also provide a proof that the fixed point in the two-compartment model of liquid tumors is a global attractor. Our research provides a theoretical platform for investigating the complex interactions of tumor growth, target shedding, and drug pharmacokinetics, and can be useful to understand the effects of shed target on the efficacy of immunotherapies and support dose optimization.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cardiac fibrillation is caused by self-sustaining spiral waves that occur in the myocardium, some of which  can be pinned to heterogeneities 
such as blood vessels in tissue.  These pinned spirals are a hinderance to the development of low energy methods for cardiac defibrillation; 
a small electrical voltage gradient applied across the heart is sufficient to unpin and eliminate these spirals, but only if it is applied at the correct phase which forms a unpinning window. 
 When multiple pinned spirals exist these unpinning windows do not generally overlap.  Using phase-based reduction techniques, we apply tools from control 
theory to design an energy optimal, externally applied voltage gradient to entrain a heterogeneous collection of pinned spirals.  
When the phases overlap they can be simultaneously unpinned by applying an external voltage gradient pulse at an appropriate moment.  
Numerical validation of this novel approach is also presented using bidomain model simulations.  This method explicitly incorporates heterogeneity in the problem formulation 
and is guaranteed to entrain the spirals provided their phase response curves and nominal unperturbed frequencies fall within some prespecified window.  
Additionally, it requires no real-time feedback about the system state.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is characterized by an increase of heart rate of 30 beats per minute (40 bpm in patients aged 12-19 years) upon a postural change, combined with the presence of orthostatic symptoms. In addition to these criteria, recent studies have shown that POTS patients exhibit large low frequency ~0.1 Hz heart rate and blood pressure oscillations upon a postural change when compared to control subjects. Moreover, several studies have hypothesized that POTS patients express autoantibodies binding to $\beta_{1,2}$ and $M_2$ receptors. These receptors are abundant on the sinoatrial node, while $\alpha_1$ receptors are associated with smooth muscle cells. This study uses mathematical modeling to test if subjects expressing these antibodies experience augmented ~0.1 Hz oscillations. To do so, we develop a multiscale model using a systems level five-compartment cardiovascular model, a baroreflex control regulating heart rate, cardiac contractility, and vascular resistance in response to changes in blood pressure. Specific attention is paid to the control of heart rate achieved by adding a sinoatrial node cell model. We demonstrate that by changing receptor sensitivity we can predict ~0.1 Hz oscillations in POTS patients, Finally, we show that by varying system level model parameters we can simulate characteristic POTS phenotypes and study effects of POTS in patients with low blood volume, known to have more severe POTS symptoms.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cardiac tissue is modeled as a nonlinear system that can exhibit chaotic dynamics. However, little experimental evidence has been collected to verify these dynamics. This study aims to both quantify and qualify the chaotic nature of cardiac tissue from a cardiac system’s electrical response to a range of periodic forcing signals including high frequencies which emulate arrhythmias. Tissue response was recorded as the voltage signal from a single cell within a frog ventricle. The resulting action potential durations (APDs) were measured as a time series for analysis with Lyapunov exponents. Results have shown to give negative Lyapunov exponents for forcing frequencies around APD bifurcation events and positive exponents during complex response. In addition, stable period-three orbits, and several unstable periodic orbits of APDs were identified during the complex response, further suggesting that the tissue response is not random but in fact chaotic. This will facilitate the development of methods to control and terminate arrhythmias.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>We formulate a general mapping from singular image systems to regularized image systems for use with the method of regularized Stokeslets and apply it to biologically relevant flows within a fluid-filled, spherical cavity. The method of regularized Stokeslets has been heavily applied to micro-scale biofluids problems such as microorgianism locomotion. It is based on the boundary integral form of the Stokes equations where the singular fundamental solution (the "Stokeslet") is replaced with a smooth approximation. The method can be modified such that certain boundary conditions are satisfied automatically via the addition of an appropriate "image system" to the regularized Stokeslet. Here, we focus on the computation of fluid flows due to distributions of forces within a fluid-filled, spherical cavity because no regularized image system has been derived for this specific setting and because of its importance to flows driven by active structures within cells. We present two example problems in this context: the flow due to a translating particle and the flow due to a relaxing flexible filament contained in the cavity.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Blood coagulation is a complex network of biochemical reactions necessary to form a blood clot. The process occurs in three stages (initiation, amplification &amp; propagation) in the presence of flow. Inhibition occurs at each stage to avoid over-clotting. Initiation in the tissue factor pathway begins when clotting factor VIIa in the plasma binds its cofactor, tissue factor (TF) forming an active enzyme complex (TF:VIIa). Next, clotting factor X in the plasma binds with TF:VIIa and is enzymatically cleaved into activated factor X (Xa). Xa is required for other reactions as coagulation progresses. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is known to be a strong inhibitor during initiation, with the primary mechanism of binding to Xa in the plasma and then rebinding to TF:VIIa to form the quaternary complex TF:VIIa:TFPI:Xa. However, previous mathematical models show that flow itself is a more important inhibitor than TFPI.

In this study, we re-investigate TFPI inhibition with and without the presence of flow. We consider previous static experimental studies of TFPI, where additional inhibitory reactions were suggested to be at play. We use mathematical models and constrained optimization to fit the new reaction schemes to multiple sets of data simultaneously. We find the new scheme for TFPI better fits the experimental data. Then, we put these new schemes into a simplified model of coagulation under flow to revisit the relationship between flow and TFPI inhibition.

    <EventDescription>Shadow enhancers are short regions of DNA that regulate developmental genes and ensure consistent expression patterns within the embryo. These multi-enhancer systems have been observed to drive more robust transcription than single enhancer systems. Nevertheless, it remains unclear why the arrangement of transcription factor (TF) binding sites happens across multiple enhancers rather than within a single large enhancer. In this work, we use a mathematical and computational approach to study enhancer systems with varying numbers of TF binding sites, enhancers, and distinct binding affinities. We model these systems as chemical reaction networks under stochastic dynamics and analyze the resulting trends in transcriptional noise and fidelity. The results of this work suggest that there may not be a strong selection pressure at the transcriptional level on having multiple enhancers. We also compare strategies for enhancer origins and present modeling results for the duplication and splitting of enhancers.  </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>From an evolutionary perspective, is it harder to develop and maintain a communication system within a single organism, or one that works between individuals?
Let us consider an artificial life simulation, in which individual agents (virtual organisms) have a bit string genome that encodes abstract chemical reactions.
A selection-mutation process acting on a population of agents can evolve an artificial regulatory network that solves a computational problem.
Two communication problems are of interest: Copy and PairCopy.
Both require a two-bit word to be copied from a sender cell to a receiver cell over a one-bit channel.
For Copy, the cells are genetically identical and part of a single agent.
For PairCopy, they are from two genetically distinct agents.
In experiments, a greater fraction of populations evolved complete solutions to PairCopy compared to Copy.
Solving PairCopy is apparently easier because one agent with a sending mechanism and another with a receiving mechanism gain fitness from interacting; both mechanisms increase in popularity as soon as they arise.
Solving Copy is harder, because if both mechanisms are present, their fitness cannot be realized until a single agent inherits them both.
However, populations that solve the PairCopy problem show lower genetic diversity compared to Copy; population-wide homogeneity is favored and mutations are more likely to be deleterious, so maintaining a solution to PairCopy is harder.

    <EventDescription>All sexually reproducing organisms are faced with a fundamental decision: to invest valuable resources and energy in reproduction or in their own survival. This trade-off between reproduction and survival represents the 'cost of reproduction' and occurs across a diverse range of organisms. It is widely assumed that cooperative breeding behavior in vertebrates — when individuals care for young who are not their own — results in part from costly parental care. When caring for young is too costly, parents need help from related or unrelated individuals to successfully raise their offspring. Cooperatively breeding birds and mammals are also more commonly found in unpredictable environments than non-cooperative species, suggesting that decisions about when to breed or help may represent complex yet critical choices that depend on the energy individuals have available to dedicate to reproduction given the harshness of the current environment. Here, we introduce a novel, socially-tiered model of a cooperatively breeding species that incorporates the influence environmental stochasticity. Through numerical and analytical methods, we use this model to show that costly reproduction and environmental variability are compounding factors in the evolution and maintenance of cooperation.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The development of high throughput in vitro assays has had profound impact on toxicological assessment. It has the potential to lead to more efficient, accurate, and less animal-intensive testing. However, it is challenging to take advantage of the numerous in vitro tests in the actual risk assessment process. On the other hand, the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework has emerged as a rich source for mechanistic knowledge and as a potential tool to select and structure in vitro assays in predictive models for toxicity. In this study, we utilize knowledge encoded in AOPs to build a predictive model for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) using a Bayesian network approach. We reviewed AOPwiki and related literature to construct a comprehensive AOP network regarding DILI, which represents our current knowledge for molecular events that lead to liver injury by drugs and other chemicals. This constitutes a graphical guide to develop in vitro assays to detect liver injury. As the basic structure of AOP networks are directed acyclic graphs, they provide a natural opportunity to construct models with Bayesian networks. We present a Bayesian network model based on DILI AOP networks using L1000 and Tox21 data for gene expression and nuclear receptor binding. Due to the incorporation of significant expert knowledge in the form of AOP, the Bayesian network model has the advantage of being parsimonious and requires only a small number of assays to predict the risk of toxicity.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Calcium signaling is organized in a hierarchical manner. At the lowest (most microscopic) level, stochastic release of $Ca^{2+}$ through a single IP3 receptor results in a small localized increase in cytoplasmic $Ca^{2+}$ concentration.  The IP3 receptors are typically tightly clustered, which means that a $Ca^{2+}$ blip can stimulate the release of additional $Ca^{2+}$ through neighboring receptors, so that the entire cluster emits a localized `puff'.  There is considerable evidence that calcium puffs are nonlinear stochastic phenomena: it has been observed for instance that IP3 channels can be highly active even when the average open probability is less than half its maximum. In this talk we use the theory of Large Deviations to determine accurate estimates for the frequency of calcium puffs in both excitable and-nonexcitable cells.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Non-invasive data collection in real-world settings with wearables provides a new opportunity for characterizing daily physiology. However, accurate and efficient characterization remains an open problem because the complex autoregressive noise of the data makes it challenging to use simple and efficient methods for inference of clock proxies (e.g., least squares method). In this talk, we will introduce a simple approximation that alters the noise structure and thus enables one to use the least squares method. We will show its usefulness for personalized inference of circadian phase of heart rate rhythms by testing the simple method on over 100,000 days of real-world data.

    <EventDescription>At the cortex of Dictyostelium, the actin cytoskeleton localizes in discrete patches which have been shown to oscillate at different phases. Recent findings suggest that the spatial coordination of actin oscillators is regulated by the G protein subunit G$\beta$, which diffuses rapidly throughout the cell. Upon G$\beta$ sequestration, the following phenomena are observed: (1) higher fraction of actin patches becomes oscillatory; (2) phase difference between different sectors becomes smaller. To understand these observations, we model each actin patch as a conditional oscillator, which is governed by an excitable activator-inhibitor model coupled by bulk diffusion of G$\beta$. Assuming that G$\beta$ promotes the actin activator Arp2/3 in each actin patch, we find that actin oscillations can emerge when the G$\beta$ concentration is low. We show that spatial heterogeneity of G$\beta$ can lead to phase differences in actin oscillators. We consider how additional spatial coupling by Arp2/3 can influence spatial patterning in this system.

    <EventDescription>Robustness, the invariant development of organs despite environmental influence and stochastic fluctuation, is crucial to organ function and organismal fitness. An Arabidopsis flower robustly develops four sepals that are of constant size, shape, and position. This enables the sepals to tightly close and protect the inner reproductive organs during their development. We previously found that the development related myb-like1 (drmy1) mutant develops sepals of variable size and shape, correlating with variable hormone patterning. But it remained unknown how the DRMY1 gene makes hormonal patterns and sepal development robust. In this work, we found that the drmy1 mutant has defective ribosomal function which is sufficient to disrupt robust hormone patterning. Using hormone mutants and treatments, we found that the change in hormone patterning is necessary and sufficient for variable sepal development. In addition, we propose that these hormone changes act to alleviate ribosome defects in this mutant and causes developmental variability as a side effect. Our results show that robust organ development needs robust hormone patterning, which in turn needs proper ribosomal function. Our work further suggests that ribosomes, an essential part of every cell, can have specific influences on how groups of cells are coordinated to grow into organs of robust size and arrangement.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The importance of drug design cannot be overemphasized. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) based drug design has begun to gain momentum due to the great advancement in experimental data, computational power and learning models. However, a major issue remains for all AI-based learning models is efficient molecular representations. Here we propose Neighborhood complex (NC) based molecular featurization (or feature engineering), for the first time. In particular, we reveal deep connections between NC and Dowker complex (DC) for molecular interaction based bipartite graphs, for the first time. Further, NC-based persistent spectral models are developed and the associated persistent attributes are used as molecular descriptors or fingerprints. To test our models, we consider protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our NC based machine learning (NCML) models, in particular, NC-based gradient boosting tree (NC-GBT), are tested on three most-commonly used datasets, i.e., including PDBbind-v2007, PDBbind-v2013 and PDBbindv2016, and extensively compared with other existing state-of-the-art models. It has been found that our NCML models can achieve state of-the-art results.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>A finite element solution of an ion channel dielectric continuum model such as Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) and a system of Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations (PNP) requires tetrahedral meshes for an ion channel protein region, a membrane region, and an ionic solvent region as well as an interface fitted irregular tetrahedral mesh of a simulation box domain. However, generating these meshes is very difficult and highly technical due to the three related regions having very complex geometrical shapes. In this talk, we will introduce a new and efficient mesh generation package for finite element ion channel calculation. Then several applications are presented.

    <EventDescription>Recent advancements in computational fluid dynamics have enabled researchers to efficiently explore problems that involve moving elastic boundaries immersed in fluids for problems such as cardiac fluid dynamics and animal swimming. The work presented here focuses on the development and implementation of such methods and models for the pumping of the tubular hearts. In particular, we develop neuromechanical models that integrate feedback between the conduction of action potentials, the contraction of cardiac muscles, the movement of the heart wall, and the motion of the blood. The coupling between the elastic heart tube and the viscous blood is resolved using a 2D and 3D parallelized and adaptive implementation of the immersed boundary method, IBAMR. These models are then used to resolve proposed pumping mechanisms in tubular hearts, including peristalsis and dynamic suction pumping. In addition, the challenges of refilling the heart tube at low Reynolds numbers are considered. The relatively rigid pericardium and torsionally wound muscles are included in the model to study their role in refilling. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) leads researchers to consider immunotherapies in hopes of improving treatment outcomes. Monotherapy with anti-PD-1 has proved to be unsuccessful likely due to added layers of immunosuppression besides the PD-L1/PD-1 axis. Murine experiments show that CCR2+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which suppress T cells, are chemo-kinetically recruited by gliomas to the brain. Further, combination treatment with PD-1 and a CCR2 antagonist unmasked the immune checkpoint inhibitor’s ability to reduce tumor growth. To gain insight on glioma-immune dynamics with the goal of future extension to immunotherapy, we develop and analyze an ODE model which includes immunosuppression via the PD-L1/PD-1 axis and MDSCs. We conduct parameter sensitivity analysis in combination with the approximate Bayesian computation rejection method to identify the interaction between the two layers of immunosuppression.

    <EventDescription>From preventing scurvy to being part of religious rituals, citrus are intrinsically connected to human health and perception. From tiny mandarins to head-sized pummelos, citrus capability of hybridization provides a vastly diverse array of fruit sizes and shapes, which in turn corresponds to a diversity of flavors and aromas. These sensory qualities are tightly linked to oil glands in the citrus skin. The oil glands are also key to understanding fruit development, and the essential oils contained by them are fundamental in the food and perfume industries. We study the shape of citrus based on 3D X-ray CT scan reconstruction of 163 different citrus samples comprising 58 different species and cultivars, including samples of all fundamental citrus species. First, using the power of X-rays and image processing, we are able to compare and contrast size ratios between different tissues, such as the size of the skin compared to the rind or the flesh. Second, we model the fruit shape as an ellipsoidal surface, and later we study and infer possible oil gland distributions on this surface using principles of directional statistics. We finally compare and contrast these overall fruit shape models along their gland distributions across different citrus species. This morphological modeling will allow us later to link genotype with phenotype, furthering our insight on how the physical shape is genetically specified in DNA.

    <EventDescription>Through my work with the NSF-backed group TRIUMPHS (TRansforming Instruction in Undergraduate Mathematics via Primary Historical Sources), I authored a primary-source project based on Joseph Fourier's ``The Analytical Theory of Heat' for use in introductory ordinary and partial differential equations classrooms.  His classic work is surprisingly accessible! The student response to this project has been overwhelmingly positive, both from engineering-track students getting ready to take thermodynamics as well as students studying mathematics trying to grapple with complicated ideas in analysis such as Fourier series.  This talk will showcase the project as well as provide the audience with some options and guidance for successful implementation in their classroom.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>We are interested in the biophysics of forward and backward propagation of action potentials (APs), as they are both important for learning. The axon initial segment (AIS) initiates APs in a variety of neurons.
Pyramidal cells contain two subtypes of voltage-gated sodium channel: $Na_{V}1.2$ (high threshold) and $Na_{V}1.6$ (low threshold).
These channels are nonuniformly distributed in the AIS: $Na_{V}1.2$ density is greatest near the soma, and $Na_{V}1.6$ density peaks in the distal AIS.
The purpose of this spatially separated $Na_{V}$ distribution remains unclear.  
We simulate a variety of hypothetical $Na_{V}$ distributions in the AIS —presumably available to evolution— and compute the threshold for backpropagation.
Counterintuitively, published simulations suggest that placing high threshold $Na_{V}1.2$ channels near the soma lowers backpropagation threshold [Hu et al., Distinct contributions of Nav1.6 and Nav1.2 in action potential initiation and backpropagation, 2009].
We find that this is true for axonal stimulation.
However with somatic stimulation, we find that separating $Na_{V}$ subtypes can impede or promote backpropagation.
Modifying the right-shift of $Na_{V}1.2$ kinetics reveals that (I) $Na_{V}$ availability and its time constant explain how proximal $Na_{V}1.2$  promotes backpropagation with axonal stimulation, and (II) steady-state activation explains how separating $Na_{V}$ subtypes can impede or promote backpropagation with somatic stimulation. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Canine distemper virus (CDV), similar to the human measles virus, is an extremely contagious virus that can cause outbreaks in dense canine populations such as shelters. Previous models of CDV in animal shelters have shown that by euthanizing animals at a high rate and testing the population swiftly shelters can prevent or reduce outbreaks. The current study was motivated by previous models to show that quarantining dogs, implementing a foster system, and euthanizing, when necessary, can also reduce outbreaks in animal shelters. Previous models incorporated euthanasia but have not addressed the vital impact of quarantining and optimization on population safety and virus control. The spread of CDV was modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations through $S$ (susceptible), $V$ (vaccinated), $E$ (exposed), $I$ (infected), $Q$ (quarantined), and $R$ (recovered) classes. We use optimal control theory, based on Pontryagin's principle, and numerical simulations to study the impact of quarantining to reduce euthanizing and the spread of disease within shelters.

    <EventDescription>The interaction between respiratory diseases of influenza, and pneumonia is vital to understanding how coinfection might affect the transmission of pneumonia. We formulate an ordinary differential equation based model to analyze the qualitative behavior of influenza and pneumonia coinfection. We determine the effective reproduction number and show that in the absence of coinfection, disease-free, boundary, and endemic equilibria are locally and globally stable. Further, the model undergoes a backward bifurcation in the presence of the coinfection. Epidemiologically, this means that in order to eliminate the disease it may no be sufficient to bring $R_0$ below one. We then present numerical simulations to support the analytical results.

    <EventDescription>Bursting behavior is exhibited by a plethora of biological systems, such as neurons and pancreatic beta cells. The creation of new fast spikes on a bursting system is a relevant phenomenon, as it increases the duty cycle of the system. We investigate the dynamics underlying different spike-adding processes by studying the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model, a prototype model for square-wave (or fold/hom) bursting that also exhibits tapered (or fold/Hopf) bursting. The connection between the spike-adding processes and the bifurcation structure of the system is detailed, and we propose a global scheme that locates each  spike-adding process found in the model with respect to the bifurcation diagram. This global scheme provides a theoretical explanation to the different interspike-interval bifurcation diagrams (IBD) that have appeared in the literature for different models. We also explain the transitions between different spike-adding processes, a crucial point not previously studied.

    <EventDescription>There are two defining features of cortical activity.  First, neuronal population response to a sensory stimulus or motor action is complex and diverse, with neurons showing very heterogeneous activity.  Second, neurons are notoriously unreliable, where the trial-to-trial responses of populations of neurons are exceedingly variable.  In this talk I will outline modeling and analysis from my group that argues that both of these features arise from the known structure of synaptic wiring in cortical circuits.  We will explore how the spatial and temporal wiring of strongly coupled recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons can produce emergent low dimensional population-wide variability that captures the salient features of real neuronal response. Our general modeling approach has given insights into: how subject attention shifts population responses, the propagation and communication of activity across layers of neurons, the learning of attractor dynamics in neuronal circuits, the distribution of stimulus tuning in early visual areas, and how the brain does inference in complex sensory worlds.

    <EventDescription>Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules play spectacularly versatile roles in living cells.  Emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology point to RNA as the central regulator and information carrier.  We are interested in predicting RNA structure, stability, and kinetics from the nucleotide sequence, and the design of molecules for therapeutic applications.  For example, given the limited availability of crystal/NMR structures, how to build the native fold from the sequence?  For a given RNA target, how to predict RNA-small molecule interaction and identify small molecules as potential drugs?  Using physical and chemical principles, we recently developed IsRNA for RNA 3D structure prediction and RLDock for RNA-small molecule interactions. I will describe these new approaches and the proof of principles in RNA 3D structure prediction and in predicting RNA-small molecule binding.

    <EventDescription>For a biochemical reaction network to generate oscillation, sufficient nonlinearity of the reactions is required. To simply generate such nonlinearity in deterministic biochemical models, non-elementary reaction functions, obtained by reducing elementary reactions, have been widely used. Recently, the deterministically driven non-elementary reaction functions have been heuristically used for stochastic simulations with the Gillespie algorithm. While this approach has been one of the most popular methods for efficient stochastic simulations, its validity condition has remained poorly understood. In this presentation, we derive a complete condition under which this approach can accurately capture the stochastic dynamics of reversible binding between two molecules, such as protein-DNA, the basis for oscillatory biochemical networks. Furthermore, we suggest alternative simplified reaction functions for stochastic reversible binding. This provides a universally valid framework for simplifying stochastic oscillatory biochemical networks. To facilitate the framework, we provide a computational package, ASSISTER, that performs the present framework automatically.

    <EventDescription>We study the dynamics of membranes (with stretching stiffness but zero bending stiffness) that shed vortex wakes in inviscid flows. Previous studies have focused on membranes with fixed ends, where only static deflection occurs. Here we consider instead membranes held by tethers with hinged ends, and find that a variety of unsteady large-amplitude motions, both periodic and chaotic, may occur. We characterize the dynamics over ranges of the key parameters: membrane mass density, stretching stiffness, pretension, and tether length. We find the region of instability and the small-amplitude behavior in a linearized model by solving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. We also derive asymptotic scaling laws by considering a simplified model: an infinite periodic membrane. We find qualitative similarities among all three models in terms of the oscillation frequencies and membrane shapes at small and large values of the parameters.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Centrosomes are small nucleus-associated organelles that serve as the nucleation site for microtubule arrays. These microtubule arrays interact with motor proteins such as dynein at the periphery of the cell and position the nucleus prior to division. Proper positioning is especially important in asymmetric cell division, where daughter cells inherit unequal amounts of specific factors. In polarized cells, where specific factors are segregated to opposite ends of the cell as seen in early embryos of the nematode worm C. elegans, asymmetric cell division occurs as a result of dynein-mediated centrosome positioning along the polarity axis. Using a combination of stochastic and continuum models with experimental validation, we show that centrosome asymmetry is critical for centrosome positioning in the early C. elegans embryo, and that this asymmetry arises from differential recruitment of proteins to centrosomes during their maturation process.

    <EventDescription>We here present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical investigation into the fluid flows induced by an oscillating piston in a network with two connected loops. This system is inspired by the loopy airways of bird lungs which, unlike the branched airways of mammalian lungs, exhibit directed flows throughout the breathing cycle. Such directed flows have intrigued biologists since their observation a century ago, but the underlying mechanism behind pumping without valves has remained elusive. In both experiments and numerical simulations, we find that the oscillatory flow generated by the piston in one segment of the network is transformed into a directed flow in the other segment. Our simulations reveal that flow separation and vortex shedding at network junctions serve the valuing function of directing flows with appropriate timing in the oscillation cycle. These findings suggest strategies for controlling inertial flows through network topology and junction connectivity.

    <EventDescription>Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease, but the known phenomenology can be reduced to the balance between insulin sensitivity (SI) and insulin secretion (beta-cell function, or BCF).  High BCF can overcome low SI, and low BCF is acceptable when SI is high.  More generally, if the product SI*BCF, called the Disposition Index (DI) is constant, then steady-state glucose (essentially, fasting glucose) is constant.  The DI concept, developed by Cobelli and Bergman 40 years ago, is the most fundamental principle in the diabetes field.  Mathematically, the SI-BCF plane can be viewed as the slow phase plane of a fast-slow system in which a separatrix divides trajectories that remain non-diabetic or tend towards diabetes.  Clinically, DI has the potential to provide a diagnostic marker to distinguish normal glucose tolerance, pre-diabetes and diabetes and track pathogenesis or remission over time.  Other forms of DI from other models share some of these good features, but we describe here a new DI that is easy to estimate from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).  Both glucose and insulin are needed to estimate SI and BCF from an OGTT, but DI requires only glucose, which is much easier and less expensive to measure.  The model also provides universal diagnostic cut points appropriate for all ethnicities, whether obese and insulin resistant, such as African Americans and Europeans, or lean and insulin sensitive, such as East Asians.  We confirm this with a simple dimensional analysis.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>During the development of an organism, cells specialize by transitioning between a limited set of discrete cell fates, defined by distinct gene expression profiles. These transitions occur in a characteristic sequence and are controlled by cues in the environment, such as morphogens. While quantitative models that describe signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks in great detail have been used to investigate cell differentiation, these suffer from having too many parameters to constrain with available data. Besides, their complexity makes it difficult to gain intuitive understanding. A popular and intuitive metaphor for the process of cell differentiation is the Waddington landscape, in which a differentiating cell is represented as a marble rolling down a landscape of hills and valleys, encountering decision points between different lineages, eventually settling in a valley that defines its cell fate. In this talk, I will show that this metaphor can be mathematically formalized using Catastrophe Theory, where the landscape is defined by a potential function and the different cell states correspond to attractors in the landscape. The signals the cell receives alter the landscape and control the bifurcations that destroy or create attractors. By combining this approach with approximate Bayesian computation, we show that we can quantitatively fit these models to large amounts of biological data and make novel predictions.

    <EventDescription>Neurons communicate through action potentials -- rapid spike-shaped oscillations in their membrane potential. Stimulation results in transitions between spiking and quiescent behaviours. These occur in a systematic fashion, resulting in neuronal computation. Major insights have been gained from nonlinear dynamics, which explains the mechanisms between spiking-quiescent transitions in terms of bifurcation theory and slow-fast dynamics. This is used to explain the computational properties of a cell, in terms of its dynamical structure. Despite its wide-ranging success, bifurcation theory can only be directly applied to models, and not real cells. Here, I will discuss control-based continuation and its applications to single-cell dynamics. Control-based continuation (CBC) applies numerical continuation to experiments, to perform model-free bifurcation analyses of physical systems. I will discuss theoretical results of CBC experiments for neuronal systems, highlight similarities between CBC and conventional experimental methods, and propose future research directions involving hybrid CBC-dynamic clamp studies.

    <EventDescription>One of the emerging challenges in medicine nowadays is the antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Some pathogens such as Gram-negative bacteria are particularly alarming due to their rapid adaptation to antibiotic treatments. In the face of this public health threat, mathematical models are essential for predicting the evolution of AMR and adopting better public health policies. In this work, we propose an agent-based computational model to describe the infection dynamics of the Acinetobacter baumannii Gram-negative bacterium and its resistance against the colistin antibiotic in the Valencia city hospitals. The model has been constructed by generating a synthetic population from the demographic information from the city, and a set of probability-based behavioral rules that model the interaction between individuals and the pathogen infection process. The model has been calibrated with real epidemiological data and simulations and predictions for the coming years have been carried out. The predictions suggest that the colistin-resistant A. baumannii has reached a stable situation in the Valencia city, but that its evolution has especially affected older age groups.

    <EventDescription>We present a numerical method specifically designed for simulating three-dimensional fluid--structure interaction (FSI) problems based on the reference map technique (RMT). The RMT is a fully Eulerian FSI numerical method that allows fluids and large-deformation elastic solids to be represented on a single fixed computational grid. This eliminates the need for meshing complex geometries typical in other FSI approaches, and greatly simplifies the coupling between fluid and solids. We develop a three-dimensional implementation of the RMT, parallelized using the distributed memory paradigm, to simulate incompressible FSI with neo-Hookean solids. As part of our method, we develop a field extrapolation scheme that works efficiently in parallel. Through representative examples, we demonstrate the method's suitability in investigating many-body and active systems, as well as its accuracy and convergence. The examples include settling of a mixture of heavy and buoyant soft ellipsoids, lid-driven cavity flow containing a soft sphere, and swimmers actuated via active stress. We also discuss extensions to the method to simulate poroelastic media.

    <EventDescription>Recent technological breakthroughs have enabled gathering data on large-scale and single-cell levels. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied to biological data in inferring the functions and dynamics of complex biological systems. However, the black-box AIs are insufficient for comprehensive understanding and interpreting the multiscale biological processes from complex, heterogeneous, and noisy data. Characterizing and modeling the biological processes demands novel computational tools. In this talk, we will present our works in building mathematics-driven AI models for multiple biological systems. We will discuss our topological data analysis (TDA)-driven machine learning models in learning protein mutational effects and guiding protein evolution. Moreover, we will discuss cellular dynamics from molecular and genomic scales using multiscale and data-driven modeling to uncover new insights in development and regeneration.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>With the rise of wearable technology in recent years, large-scale collections of physiological and behavioral data have become readily available for analysis. Mathematical models can effectively process these increasingly accessible signals, such as heart rate and activity, into information about the circadian rhythm of an individual. One subset of these models predicts circadian phase (often via a limit-cycle oscillator framework) based on the light and/or activity pattern of an individual, while another recently developed model instead extracts heart rate phase and other information by accounting for circadian variation, the impact of activity, and effects due to other physiological processes. The intersection of these frameworks has the potential to allow for a multifaceted and detailed understanding of an individual’s circadian rhythm, based on data collected from consumer-grade wearables. In this talk, we adapt these modeling approaches to examine circadian features across populations, including students, cancer patients, and individuals with COVID-19. We discuss large-scale differences across populations and implications of the models for tracking disease progression, using a combination of synthetic and real data in order to test algorithm performance in terms of phase extraction and anomaly detection. Finally, we explore parameter differences across populations and the effects of parameter perturbations on the models.

    <EventDescription>Oxygen transport depends on the heterogeneous distribution of red blood cells (RBCs) throughout the body. This distribution depends on how RBCs are divided or partitioned at diverging vessel branches (bifurcations) and by the presence of a flexible, porous endothelial surface layer (ESL; ˜ 1 micron thick) that coats the vessel walls. Here we consider a flexible, two-dimensional model of RBCs passing through a diverging, ESL-lined capillary bifurcation. The RBC is represented by interconnected viscoelastic elements suspended in fluid modeled by Stokes equations for viscous flow. The ESL’s resistance to flow is modeled using the Brinkman approximation for porous media with a corresponding hydraulic resistivity and its resistance to compression is modeled using an osmotic pressure difference between the ESL and free flowing plasma. For isolated cell simulations, decreasing either of these ESL properties resulted in RBC partitioning nonuniformity increasing slightly, RBC deformation decreasing, RBC velocity relative to blood flow velocity decreasing and RBCs penetrating more deeply into the ESL. Decreased RBC deformation decreases release of vasodilators such as ATP and nitric oxide, affecting vascular regulation, and increased penetration has been correlated with more clotting. We will also share preliminary results using two RBCs that suggest that increased interaction increases partitioning nonuniformity, RBC deformation and RBC penetration into the ESL.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Most fluid dynamics work on organismal locomotion and dispersal has considered cases where either one organism actively locomotes in a quiescent fluid or many organisms passively drift with the fluid. Theoretical, computational, and experimental studies that consider both methods of transport are often limited to a small number of organisms across small scales or focus on fluid dynamic interactions between many microscopic individuals with simplified behavior. Agent-based simulations reveal complex emergent phenomena and collective behavior, but nearly all studies neglect background flows. Understanding the complex interactions between dynamic flows and small organism behavior for navigation, settlement, and dispersal has been a long-standing challenge.

In this talk, I will introduce an open-source, computational framework for modeling the collective motion of microscopic organisms in 2D or 3D fluid flow near immersed structures. This library, Planktos, leverages high-performance numerical libraries to provide a complete agent-based environment in which to conduct and visualize simulations. Features include automated import of VTK data specifying time-varying fluid velocity fields, import of static mesh structures acting as solid barriers to agents, calculation of the FTLE field for generalized deterministic movement, an Ito stochastic differential equation solver and the ability to specify ad-hoc agent behavior, and native plotting.

    <EventDescription>
Understanding sleep has been a central topic in neuroscience. In order to explain experimental findings, researchers have raised different sleep hypotheses (Tononi &amp; Cirelli, 2014; Watson et al., 2016). To verify those hypotheses computationally, we first build models that can reproduce the neuronal pattern both in wake and sleep. We then simulate those models, in which sleep-wake transitions are achieved by alternating the electrophysiology of neurons in the network(Esser et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2020). However, in our model, we also observe spontaneous transitions in the entire network between sleep and wake states that occur based on simple Hebbian rules. This demonstrates a network-based way to achieve the sleep-wake transition. 

Our model for each neuron contains two important parts: a spiking cortical neuron model(Tatsuki et al., 2016) that includes calcium signaling, and a calcium synaptic plasticity model(Graupner &amp; Brunel, 2012; Inglebert et al., 2020) that regulates the synaptic weights within the network. We will show how to bridge those two models and attain sleep-wake transitions in networks of thousands of neurons as our main result.

Our study shows that the dynamics of synaptic weights within the network is enough to change the overall behavior of the neuron network between sleep and awake. We hope our study can deepen the understanding that sleep or wake states are a network property, more than an enforced switch between two physiological states.

    <EventDescription>The albatross is one of the most efficient travelers in the animal world. One species, the wandering albatross, can fly nearly 500 miles in a single day, with just an occasional flap of its wings and minimal food/energy consumption. The flying phenomenon performed by the albatross, if conducted ideally, can lead to an energy neutral flight cycle: the Dynamic Soaring (DS) phenomenon/cycle. This phenomenon basically is about how soaring birds, such as, but not limited to albatross, can utilize wind shear to fly almost for free. In this presentation, we show that differential-geometric control theory can reveal, and in fact, characterizes the flight physics of the DS flight physics along with novel characterization with extremum seeking phenomenon. This mathematical effort in formulation and nonlinear control analysis can advance the possibility of bio-mimicking of efficient bird flights by unmanned systems.

    <EventDescription>Previous work involving integro-difference equations of a single species in a homogenous environment has emphasized spreading behaviour in unbounded habitats. We show that under suitable conditions, a simple scalar integro-difference equation incorporating a strong Allee effect and overcompensation can produce solutions where the population persists in an essentially bounded domain without spread despite the homogeneity of the environment. These solutions are robust in that they occupy a region of full measure in the parameter space. We develop orbit diagrams showing various patterns of nonspreading solutions from stable equilibria, period two, to chaos. We show that from a relatively uniform initial density with small stochastic perturbations a population consisting of multiple isolated patches can emerge. In ecological terms this work suggests a novel endogenous mechanism for the creation of patch boundaries.

    <EventDescription>We show that the combination of Allee effects and noise can produce a stochastic process with alternating sudden decline to a low population phase, followed, after a random time, by abrupt increase in population density. We introduce a new, flexible, deterministic model of attenuated Allee effects, which interpolates between the logistic and a usual Allee model. 
Into this model we incorporate environmental and demographic noise. The solution of the resulting Kolmogorov forward equation shows a dichotomous distribution of residence times with heavy occupation of high, near saturation, and low population states. Investigation of simulated sample paths reveals that indeed attenuated Allee effects and noise, acting together, produce alternating, sustained, low and high population levels. We find that the transition times between the two types of states are approximately exponentially distributed, with different parameters, rendering the embedded hi-low process approximately Markov.	</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Many problems in the life sciences involve distributions over some metric space. Kernel mean embedding (KME) is an elegant framework to process such data: the distribution is represented as an average of the sample embeddings mapped to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Starting from this embedding, we can suggest a kernel-based toolkit to predict, compare, visualize, optimize and learn from such distributions. We present a case study on how KME can be applied to pharmaceutical processes. Current methods only use the first two order statistics (i.e., mean and variance) to represent the particle size distributions, losing a lot of information. The KME framework allows us to efficiently represent and manipulate all the characteristics of the distributions of interest. In the end, we will reflect on how KME can further be used in the broader life sciences.

    <EventDescription>Observed in recent cholera outbreaks is the presence of two serotypes, strains of the cholera bacteria that mainly differ in their induced host immunity. Each serotype induces both self-immunity and a degree of cross-immunity to the other strain for some duration. We combine and extend previously studied SIRP and multi-strain models to consider the strain diversity of cholera. We explore various ways of incorporating host immunity into this deterministic multi-strain model, characterizing the dynamics and long-term behavior, particularly in the case of serotype coexistence.	</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The World Health organization, American Burn Association, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, collectively, estimate 1.1 million people in the United States suffer from burn injuries annually. Understanding the collective effects of burns is fundamental for gauging injury severity and predicting healing outcomes. To repair tissue damage, an overlapping, coordinated sequence of phases (hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling) occurs. Pathological inflammation during this process impairs wound healing, increasing the likelihood of adverse individual outcomes. Here, we introduce an immunophysiological model of local dermal wound healing following burn injury. The model consists of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe dynamics between various innate (neutrophils, macrophages) and adaptive (T lymphocytes) immune cells as well as fibroblast activity at the site of injury. A representative parameter set was identified from published literature to establish baseline values. Using the time series predictions for the baseline values as the comparator, numerical simulations were performed, allowing us to further verify the biological plausibility of its behaviors.  We then utilize the model to first explore the effect of different inflammatory profiles in promoting timely tissue healing and preventing secondary infection for thermal burn injury.

    <EventDescription>During sleep, brain structures engage in a dialogue which facilitates memory processes. However, besides "hub" areas such as medial prefrontal cortex and entorhinal cortex, how the whole cortex is dynamically coupled to the hippocampus is unknown. We characterized cortical resting state activity with voltage-sensitive imaging and electrocorticography, together with electrophysiological potentials from the hippocampus.
Cortical resting state activity is characterized by transient events, whose size distribution is be well approximated by a power law distribution, as in critical systems, but stratifying transients by magnitude reveals different modes of transient activity. While small transients have a limited number of co-activation modes, larger transients propagate as waves spanning a substantial portion of the cortical surface and can be classified based on their origin: one family is preceded by Retrosplenial cortex activation, the other by Somatosensory Cortex. Interestingly, hippocampal gamma power is proportional to the size of the cortical transients and preferentially associated with retrosplenial-led transients. We also found a significant causal interaction from RS activation to hippocampal gamma amplitude. Ripple events appear instead to have a much looser association with cortical activity evolution.
These results begin to characterize resting state network dynamics at a fast time scale and suggest updates to our current theories of memory processes.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Synchronization of neurons is believed to play a crucial role in the brain under normal conditions, for instance, in the context of cognition and learning and under pathological conditions such as Parkinson disease or epileptic seizures. In the latter case, when synchronization represents an undesired state, understanding the mechanisms of desynchronization is of particular importance. In other words, the possible transitions from synchronized to desynchronized regimes and vice versa should be investigated. It is known that such dynamical transitions involve the formation of partial synchronization patterns, where only one part of the network is synchronized. In the present talk, we discuss the occurrence of peculiar partial synchronization patterns such as chimera states and solitary states in neural networks.

    <EventDescription>The polarity and stability of the microtubule cytoskeleton are critical in supporting long-range directed transport of cellular cargo and long-term survival of neurons. However, microtubules also need to be dynamic and reorganize in response to injury events. Multiple mechanisms that contribute to the primarily minus-end-out filament organization in Drosophila dendrites have been identified. However, we lack an understanding of how these complex mechanisms ensure both healthy function over long time periods and dramatic rearrangement in response to injury. I will discuss a spatially-explicit mathematical model of the dendritic microtubule system in Drosophila neurons. This framework suggests several hypotheses for the microtubule dynamics, which we test using a stochastic model and validate with fluorescence experiments. Pairing this modeling framework with biological experiments has the potential to provide insight into the impact of various parameters and control mechanisms on polarity and dynamics in Drosophila dendrites.

    <EventDescription>The transport of cargo within cells is typically carried out by a combination of active motor-driven motion on cytoskeletal filaments and diffusion in the cytoplasm. It is known that the  morphology of the cytoskeletal network differs between cell types and plays a significant role in determining transport. However, the network is not static but can turnover on the same time scale as the transport of cargo on the network. Here, we study the transport of cargo carried by myosin motors on a dynamic actin network. We use a stochastic simulation model that accounts for both active transport along filaments as well as passive diffusion in the cytoplasm and incorporates the dynamics of the explicitly represented actin network. We show how filament treadmilling rates affect cargo transport along with filament lengths, densities and motor attachment/detachment rates. In particular, using simulations and simple analytics, we show that the turnover rates of the network can be optimized for fast transport and that the optimal dynamics regime is consistent with in vivo conditions. Additionally the optimal regime can be tuned by both cargo properties and filament densities and lengths suggesting new ways for cells to regulate transport.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>
In this talk, I will illustrate a few applications of impulsive stochastic differential equations to ecological topics. In particular, I used them to study how plants respond to drought in drylands, and how wildfires will influence plant communities and their recovery. Both topics are of uttermost social and ecological relevance, given the severity of the effects climate change is predicted to have in global drylands. I represented both fires and rainfall as pulse (delta-like) perturbations to dynamical systems (ODEs). Rainfall is an intermittent input of water for the soil and plants. Plants are well adapted to the nonlinear input of water, which promotes survival and sustains biodiversity in drylands. Wildfires, in combination with climate change, can be shifting the recovery trajectory of Mediterranean forests to an alternative ecosystem state, namely an open shrubland, which is often an undesirable state from a human perspective.

    <EventDescription>Pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems has been extensively studied in the context of growing domains, with domain evolution implicated in pattern robustness and selection, with evolving domains also being a natural modelling framework for developmental scenarios. However, the majority of work to date has considered prescribed domain changes, rather than the more realistic prospect of concentration-dependent growth. In this talk, we develop a framework to model reaction-diffusion systems on manifolds that evolve in a concentration-dependent way. In particular, we pose a general form of one-dimensional domain growth, and extend this to $n$-dimensional manifolds under mild constitutive assumptions in the absence of more sophisticated mechanical considerations. Via linear stability analysis, using a comparison principle for non-autonomous evolving systems, we explore the impact of concentration-dependent growth on the initiation of pattern formation, showing that it can be reduced to the analysis of a particular prescribed growth model. We then numerically demonstrate a variety of dynamical regimes in one dimension, before presenting a variety of examples in planar geometries, which each give rise to a variety of new phenomena due to the coupling of reactions, diffusion, and growth. The dynamics we observe raise important questions in the modelling and analysis of biological systems, in addition to further mathematical analysis.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Perceptual bistability refers to an observer’s susceptibility to admit two interpretations of an unchanging stimulus. Neurophysiological studies of bistable perception typically partition neural measurements into stimulus-based epochs where differences are assessed based on subject perceptual reports. Computational studies of bistable perception incorporate hypothesized mechanisms into models that replicate established behavioral principles of perception. To bridge the two approaches, we integrated techniques from data-driven dynamical systems and dimensionality reduction to derive intrinsic neural features from electrocorticography recordings in primary auditory cortex from humans performing an auditory bistable task. Within the derived features, we identified an ensemble of oscillators that exhibited phase-shifts entrained to a slowly-drifting variable aligned with subject-reported changes in perception. Projecting the neural data onto the drifting oscillators revealed low-dimensional dynamics along manifolds with discernible attracting states. By examining the neural data on timescales consistent with those used in computational models, we provide neural evidence supporting the biological plausibility of attractor-based computational principles. The feature extraction techniques used here generalize across recording modalities and are appropriate for instances when hypothesized low-dimensional dynamics characterize an underlying neural system.

    <EventDescription>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic, membranous network of tubules and sheets stretching from the nuclear envelope to the cell periphery. Its crucial roles include facilitating the diffusive spread of proteins, lipids and ions throughout the cell, but the specific effects of network structure on these processes are not well understood. In prior work we developed fast, agent-based simulations of particles diffusing on tubular networks, using pre-computed propagators to enable particles to step efficiently from node to node. We leverage this method, together with analytic results for search times on a network, to explore the effects of heterogeneous network morphology on particle encounter kinetics. Our results are compared to dynamic in vivo measurements of photoactivated membrane proteins spreading through the ER, as well as accumulation of proteins at ER exit sites. In particular, we show that dynamic network rearrangements increase the spatial variability of protein spreading from an initial bolus. Our results highlight key structure-function relationships for the ER, linking its network architecture with its role as an intracellular transport system.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The formation of a blood clot involves complex biophysical and biochemical processes that occur under flow. In the event of an injury, platelets become active and weakly aggregate to form a plug at the injury site. Activated platelets express binding sites for procoagulant species, and platelet surface-bound complexes convert zymogen prothrombin into enzyme thrombin; thrombin further activates platelets and converts soluble fibrinogen molecules in the blood plasma to fibrin monomers. These monomers then polymerize to form a gel that is a major structural component of a blood clot. Fibrin(ogen) interacts with activated platelets through surface integrins that allow platelets to adhere and cohere through bonds mediated by fibrin(ogen). Experimental evidence suggests platelet integrins interact differently with fibrinogen, fibrin, and fibrin oligomer. 

We propose a mean field mathematical model of fibrin branch formation which tracks fibrinogen, fibrin, and platelet species in either a bound or unbound state. Fibrin oligomers form in both the bulk and on the surface of platelets, and flow-mediated transport will affect fluid-phase species. A kinetic fibrin polymerization model is used to model fibrin gel formation; this model is studied up until gelation, which is defined as the emergence of an oligomer of infinite size. In this presentation, we show how the gel time depends on model parameters and how platelet-fibrin(ogen) interactions affect the gel structure. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hematologic disorder and is an important cause of childhood mortality in many countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. SCD is caused by a single mutation from A to T in the $\beta$-globin gene of adult hemoglobin (HbA). This mutant hemoglobin (hemoglobin S [HbS]) polymerizes upon deoxygenation in the tissues and causes red blood cell (RBC) deformation. Increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and or HbA can inhibit polymer formation in RBCs. Here, we assessed single-RBC images and their oxygen saturation using a previously reported microfluidic system (DOI:10.1073/pnas.1914056116). We developed a machine learning method that detects Hb polymer in single RBCs based on the cell morphology and the oxygen saturation measurements. This method uses the principle that Hb polymer decreases RBC oxygen saturation in proportion to polymer concentration. We estimated single-RBC Hb polymer mass by integrating single-RBC oxygen saturation measurements with a hemoglobin solubility model (DOI:10.1073/pnas.1922004117) that describes cooperative oxygen binding to Hb. Then we used the polymer mass estimates for different oxygen tensions to infer the distribution of HbF across RBCs for patients treated with hydroxyurea and patients who underwent a gene therapy that enhances HbF production (DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2029392). We also estimated the distribution of HbA between RBCs for patients with sickle cell trait.

    <EventDescription>In sickle cell disease (SCD), red blood cell sickling is driven by concentration dependent polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxHb). Multiple drugs in development aim to reduce sickling by stabilizing oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2), thereby decreasing the concentration of deoxHb to prevent polymerization. However, by stabilizing HbO2 these compounds also reduce the blood oxygen carrying capacity. A mathematical model accounting for the complex interrelated factors affecting hemoglobin oxygen saturation is required to determine the optimal level of HbO2 stabilization that minimizes RBC sickling while maintaining adequate oxygen carrying capacity. 
We revised and extended the model of Dash et al. 2016 so that the effect of 2,3-BPG on oxygen saturation is a function of the ratio of 2,3-BPG to available Hb and therefor reflective of the 2,3-BPG-Hb binding equilibrium. Additionally, we added equations to include expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). The extended model enables exploration of polymerization sensitivity to individual variability in total Hb expression, percent HbF expression, and 2,3-BPG levels in the presence or absence of HbO2 stabilizers. The model predicts oxygen carrying capacity becomes critically low when there is both low 2,3-BPG and high HbO2 stabilization. In the future, our model can be used to select responsive patient populations for new treatments and to explore additive and synergistic effects of combination therapies.

    <EventDescription>
The well known  SIR model is one of the simplest but efficient epidemiological models. It is determined by a set of differential equations which represent the dynamics of the susceptible, infected and recovered  population groups. These dynamics depend on the parameters $\beta$ (infection rate) and $\gamma$ (mean recovery rate). The  disease outbreak closely hinges on  $\mathcal{R}_0=\displaystyle\frac{\beta}{\gamma}$, known as the  reproduction number. 

If $\mathcal{R}_0$ is too large, a great proportion of the susceptible population becomes infected yielding to an undesirable peak of the infected population. This peak may be reduced by implementing a set of actions, referred to as "non-pharmaceutical intervention" (NPI). The SIR-with-NPI can be modeled  by introducing  $q(t)$, the fraction of contact prevented through intervention which varies between $0$ and $1$. Increasing the value of $q$ is equivalent to decreasing $\beta$ and hence, reducing the peak of the crisis. 

This effect is colloquially known as "flattering the curve" which persists as long as the intervention is held on. A premature relax or removal of the intervention, that is, to make $q$ take values near or equal to zero early, may yield to a second outbreak. On the other hand, holding restrictions for a long term results unviable. This work aims to identify strategies $q$ for controlling  the peak of the infected population curve  by means of a reduced intervention.

    <EventDescription>
Two years into the pandemic, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its practical implications on day-to-day life don't warrant much introduction. At Ghent University, we developed and extended two compartmental epidemiological models for SARS-CoV-2 in Belgium and used them to present policymakers with counterfactual scenarios.
Over the past two years, we incrementally extended our models to keep up with new scientific insights. First, the models had to be extended to account for the combined impact of novel variants of concern (VOCs) and vaccination of the general population. Then, the models had to be adapted to account for the waning immunity of the vaccines. Further, seasonal patterns emerged and variants started evading previously gained immunity. The gradual model extension required the introduction of additional degrees of freedom.
Due to the risk of overfitting, it is no longer desirable to increase the model complexity even further. Instead, the model complexity should be reduced to the bare minimum needed to model the emergence of a novel VOC in near or distant future. To this end, crucial knowledge on key model parameters estimated during the pandemic must be retained while some degrees of freedom must be reestimated. We focus on the meta-metodology of model extension and complexity reduction to present policymakers with accurate counterfactuals during future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2.

    <EventDescription>Cell assemblies, defined as groups of neurons forming temporal spike coordination, are thought to be fundamental units supporting major cognitive functions. Detecting cell assemblies is challenging since they can occur at a range of time scales and with a range of precisions, from synchronous spikes to co-variations in firing rate. A recently published cell assembly detection (CAD) algorithm (Russo and Durstewitz, 2017) addresses this ambiguity in time scale and precision; however, it is limited to spike trains with a relatively high number of total spikes, a condition which is frequently not met by the low temporal resolution data produced by calcium imaging.
	We first show how the CAD method can be modified to apply to sparse spike train data. This allows us to detect assemblies in calcium imaging data of neuronal activity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, a brain region critical for encoding and generalizing contextual memories, during contextual fear conditioning training and tests. We found that assemblies in hippocampus play a role in encoding and retrieving contextual memories. In particular, there exists a group of assemblies whose exploratory activities predict the animal’s ability to distinguish different contexts. Moreover, the mechanisms for processing contextual information are different between two genetically distinct strains of mice that are included in the experiments.

    <EventDescription>Ordinary and partial differential equation models that are age-structured have been developed to study viral kinetics. The latter are nontrivial to solve and most importantly, when utilizing this type of models, parameter estimation becomes a challenging problem. It is shown that considerable gain in efficiency can be achieved by using adaptive stepsize methods and that those should be fully implemented in order to convincingly treat the problematic integral that is part of the age-structured model. Parameter estimation is then addressed directly from the model equations by the use of constrained and derivative free optimization methods. The implementation is supported by a simulator with a friendly graphical user interface that allows the user to perform parameter estimation in a realistic time of at most several minutes as compared to performing the optimization with standard methods that are costly because they require derivative evaluations. The simulator contains fully implemented numerical methods for both the model solution and parameter estimation of the model that are integrated, both are highly efficient based on linearizations at favorable instances of the outlined methods. In the next phase, machine learning of data from patients can be incorporated to model hepatitis C viral kinetics during antiviral therapy.

    <EventDescription>Why, how, where and when animals move are fundamental questions in movement ecology. A better understanding of animal movement patterns can help explain movement behaviour at a range of spatiotemporal scales, from local scale foraging and home range exploration to large scale migration. This has immediate consequences for numerous problems arising in spatial ecology, with applications including nature conservation, endangered species, biological invasions, and ecological monitoring. Random Walks (RWs) provide a useful modelling framework for individual movement by mapping an animal’s continuous movement path as a time-series of distinct locations. The mathematical properties of correlated and/or biased RWs in 2D in the context of ecology are well known with various applications. We will extend these concepts to different types of walking behaviour in 3D space. We will discuss that alongside the usage of more complex movement models and the development of new tools for the analysis of space use in movement ecology, these null RW models warrant testing as a baseline against observed movement data for animals that exhibit strong vertical space use, so that important movement behaviour is neither discounted nor missed.

    <EventDescription>Many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have the ability to cause neighboring cells to fuse into multi-nucleated cells called syncytia. Much is still unknown about how syncytia affect the course of viral infection, including the time scale over which they form. Using data from a recent study of virus-mediated cell fusion, we use mathematical modeling to estimate the fusion rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence and absence of furin. We find that the presence of furin increases the fusion rate.

    <EventDescription>Early Afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are voltage oscillations in cardiac action potential during the repolarization phase, are linked to the appearance of cardiac arrhythmias and other heart conditions. In this presentation we analyze the dynamical mechanisms underlying the formation of arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations (EADs) in two mathematical models of cardiac cellular electrophysiology: a biophysically detailed model of a  ventricular myocyte with a large number of state variables (which allow a more faithful reproduction of experimental observations)  and a low dimensional model, more suitable for theoretical analysis. Based on a comparison of the two models, with detailed bifurcation analysis using continuation techniques in the simple model and numerical explorations in the complex model, we propose a conjectured scheme involving a hysteresis mechanism with the creation of alternans and EADs in the unstable branch. This theoretical scheme fits well with electrophysiological experimental data on EAD generation and hysteresis phenomena. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>An important function of the brain is to adapt behavior by selecting between different predictions of sequences of stimuli likely to occur in the environment. First, we present a biologically inspired network model of activation of memory items in a sequence. We show that synaptic depression and noise drive the transitions from one memory item to the next and neuronal gain controls the switching between regular and irregular (random) activation. Then, we study the branching behavior of the model, both analytically and through numerically. Results show how synaptic efficacy, retroactive inhibition and short-term synaptic depression determine the dynamics of choices between different predictions of sequences having different probabilities. Further results show that changes in the probability of the different predictions depend on variations of neuronal gain. Such variations allow the network to optimize the probability of its predictions to changing probabilities of the sequences without changing synaptic efficacy.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a commonly used treatment for medication resistant Parkinson's disease and is an emerging treatment for other neurological disorders. More recently, phase-specific adaptive DBS (aDBS), whereby the application of stimulation is locked to a particular phase of tremor, has been proposed as a strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy and decrease side effects. In this work, in the context of these phase-specific aDBS strategies, we investigate the dynamical behavior of large populations of coupled neurons in response to near-periodic stimulation, namely, stimulation that is periodic except for a slowly changing amplitude and phase offset that can be used to coordinate the timing of applied input with a specified phase of model oscillations. Using an adaptive phase-amplitude reduction strategy, we illustrate that for a large population of oscillatory neurons, the temporal evolution of the associated phase distribution in response to near-periodic forcing can be captured using a reduced order model with four state variables. Subsequently, we devise and validate a closed-loop control strategy to disrupt synchronization caused by coupling. Additionally, we identify strategies for implementing the proposed control strategy in situations where underlying model equations are unavailable by estimating the necessary terms of the reduced order equations in real-time from observables. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Traditionally, human microbiology has been based on laboratory focused cultures of microbes isolated from human specimens in patients with acute or chronic infection. These approaches primarily view human disease through the lens of a single species and its relevant clinical setting however such approaches fail to account for the surrounding environment and wide microbial diversity that exists in vivo. Given the emergence of next generation sequencing technologies and advancing bioinformatic pipelines, researchers now have unprecedented capabilities to characterise the human microbiome in terms of its taxonomy, function, antibiotic resistance and even bacteriophages. Despite this, an analysis of microbial communities has largely been restricted to ordination, ecological measures, and discriminant taxa analysis. This is predominantly due to a lack of suitable computational tools to facilitate microbiome analytics. In this talk I will introduce the available and emerging analytical techniques including integrative analysis, microbial association networks, topological data analysis (TDA) and mathematical modelling. I will then present our recently developed approach to the multi-biome that integrates bacterial, viral, and fungal communities in the context of several clinically relevant applications to patients with bronchiectasis.

    <EventDescription>The effect of malaria on the developing world is devastating.  Each year there are more than 200 million cases and over 400,000 deaths, with children under the age of five the most vulnerable. Ambitious malaria elimination targets have been set by the World Health Organization for 2030. These involve the elimination of the disease in at least 35 countries. However, these malaria elimination targets rest precariously on being able to treat the disease appropriately; a difficult feat with the emergence and spread of antimalarial drug resistance.  
 
In this talk, I will introduce several statistical and mathematical models that can be used to monitor malaria transmission and to support malaria elimination. For example, I’ll present statistical models that allow the emergence and spread of antimalarial drug resistance to be monitored, mechanistic models that capture the role of bioclimatic factors on the risk of malaria and optimal geospatial sampling schemes for future malaria surveillance. I will discuss how the results of these models have been used to update public health policy and support ongoing malaria elimination efforts.

    <EventDescription>Dynamical processes on high-dimensional spaces are often influenced by small random fluctuations, giving rise to rare events of interest.  Such rare events, which may occur over long timescales, play a wide variety of functional roles in a number of applied settings, including evolutionary dynamics, climate change, genetic circuits, and pandemic modeling.  The high dimensionality associated to these processes is often an unavoidable feature that must be considered in full.  For instance, large bacterial populations consist of a large number $g$ of cell types, called genotypes, and the genotypic composition of the population is described by a probability vector $H\in [0,1]^g,$ which lives in the $(g-1)$-dimensional probability simplex.  Random fluctuations over time lead to fluctuations in genotypic composition, which causes the probability vector to randomly vary over time in the $(g-1)$-dimensional probability simplex.  Thus, quantifying rare events over long timescales in these high-dimensional regimes becomes a formidable theoretical and computational challenge.  In this talk, we will present an explicit and efficient computational strategy for rare events analysis using a large deviations framework for a discrete-time Markov chain describing bacterial evolution of \textit{E. coli} populations.  We will particularly focus on rare events involving the frequency of some intermediate-strength genotype becoming unusually large.

    <EventDescription>Homeostasis refers to an important phenomenon in biology whereby the output $x_o$ of a system is approximately constant on variation of an input $I$. We classify different homeostasis types in input-output networks – networks with an input node and a different output node. We assume that only the input node depends explicitly on the input and that the output is the node value $x_o(I)$. We study infinitesimal homeostasis: points $I_0$ where $(dx_o/dI)(I_0) = 0$. We prove that the homeostasis types correspond
to a set of irreducible blocks each associated with a subnetwork
and these subnetworks divide into two classes: structural and
appendage. Moreover, we discover an algorithm for determining the homeostasis subnetwork without performing numerical simulations on model equations. Applications to biochemical networks will be discussed.

    <EventDescription>Machine learning algorithms have given us new tools to computational drug design. Here, I discuss our use of machine learning in optimizing binding affinity predictions and generating novel molecules for COVID-19 drug discovery. The methods we are using are based on deep neural networks, genetic algorithms, and a new data representation for molecules called SELFIES. Our drug binding predictions are comparable to state-of-the-art free energy calculations but a small fraction of the computational cost. Our generative chemistry algorithms are able to invent new molecules with high predicted activity with minimal input from a human user.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Individuals acquire protection from malaria through repeated exposure, and this immunity plays a crucial role in the dynamics of malaria spread. We develop and analyze an age-structured PDE model, which couples vector-host epidemiological dynamics with immunity dynamics. Our model tracks the acquisition and loss of anti-disease immunity during transmission and its corresponding nonlinear feedback onto the transmission parameters. We derive the basic reproduction number ($\mathcal{R}_0$) as the threshold condition for the stability of disease-free equilibrium and interpret $\mathcal{R}_0$ probabilistically as a weighted sum of cases generated by infected individuals at different infectious stages and ages. Numerical bifurcation analysis demonstrates the existence of an endemic equilibrium that spawns through a forward bifurcation in $\mathcal{R}_0$ (in the absence of disease-induced mortality) and we study the structure of this equilibrium as a function of system parameters. Our model reproduces the heterogeneity in the age distributions of immunity profiles and infection status created by frequent exposure. Motivated by the recently approved RTS,S vaccine, we also study the impact of vaccination; our results show a reduction in severe disease among young children but a small increase in severe malaria among older children due to lower acquired immunity from delayed exposure.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Incretin dependent insulin response has been shown to be impaired in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Incretin effects have been estimated experimentally by doing an Isoglycemic Intravenous Glucose Infusion Experiment (IIGI) where plasma glucose profiles are matched to that in the corresponding Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) on the same patients. As this method requires two separate experiments to be conducted on the same patients, an alternative method of estimating the incretin effect from one experiment such as the OGTT would be useful.  We developed an extended minimal model of glucose-insulin-glucagon dynamics where the effect of GLP-1 or GIP on insulin secretion in an OGTT was also investigated. This theoretical model offers an alternative method of estimating the incretin effect by fitting data from OGTT experiments where plasma incretin concentrations are monitored in addition to insulin and glucagon. A comparison of the incretin effect obtained from modeling the OGTT is made with that obtained experimentally from OGTT and the corresponding IIGI data. Such modeling also allows one to estimate the extent to which GLP-1 augmentation, for example, would increase insulin secretion in an individual with T2D who has some residual incretin effect. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Ventricular fibrillation, a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia, is sometimes preceded by electrical alternans, which is a beat-to-beat alternation in cellular action potential duration. Alternans may arise from instabilities in either voltage or intracellular calcium cycling. Although a number of techniques have been proposed to suppress alternans, most have focused on appropriately adding a new ionic current or adjusting the timing of pacing stimuli, rather than affecting intracellular calcium directly. In addition, most of the methods proposed to suppress alternans have been tested using models that do not include calcium-driven alternans. Therefore, it is important to establish a theoretical basis for understanding how control methods may perform when alternans is driven by instabilities in calcium cycling. In this study, we applied controllability analysis to a discrete map of alternans dynamics in a cardiac cell. In particular, we computed modal controllability measures to determine to what extent different control strategies can suppress alternans. The controllability measures indicated that perturbing action potential duration was the most effective strategy for suppressing both voltage- and calcium-driven alternans, although perturbing the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium load was also a promising strategy for suppressing calcium-driven alternans. Our study provides insight into the feasibility of controlling alternans driven by different mechanisms.</EventDescription>

We augment previous models for spatial anthocyanin patterns to include intramolecular anthocyanin aggregation. We show that nonlinear effects due to aggregation combined with a spatially varying total concentration allow for a spatial pattern of colored and uncolored species. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Dendritic spines are biochemical and electrical compartments in the synapse to relay neuronal signals to transform their structural information to function. They are highly dynamic in cytoskeletal structure, even in the fully developed stages. The dynamics of the secondary messenger calcium and the holoenzyme CaMKII in dendritic spines is a basis for neuronal plasticity.

The immersed boundary (IB) method is advanced for fluid-structure interaction in the context of advection-electrodiffusion of the mediating ions/molecules and synaptic excitability coupled to actin-based motility in dendritic spines. The electrodiffusion of each ionic species and its transport across ion channels is regulated by continuous chemical potentials around the membrane, recapitulating microscopic osmotic effects. Two-phase viscoelastic fluids/gels represent polymeric actin networks, and the associated IB method is formulated as a saddle-point problem. The inflow of calcium governed by electrodiffusion and actin/hydrodynamics experience the reactions to calmodulin and CaMKII. The transitions of chemical reactions-drift-diffusion are treated by a systems of master equations and Monte Carlo Gillespie method. We have model validation with 1) theoretical thermodynamics and voltage-current relationship with osmotic effects and active exchange transporters, 2) actin flow and CaMKII distribution and the associated volume changes by glutamate uncaging and depolarization with published experimental data.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator controls the pulsatile secretion of the gonadotropic hormones LH and FSH and is critical for fertility. The hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin neurones (KNDy) are thought to represent the GnRH pulse generator, since their oscillatory activity is coincident with LH pulses in the blood; a proxy for GnRH pulses. However, the mechanisms underlying GnRH pulse generation and controlling its dynamics remain elusive. We developed a mathematical model of the kisspeptin neuronal network and confirmed its predictions experimentally, showing how LH secretion is frequency-modulated as we increase the basal activity of the arcuate kisspeptin neurones in vivo using continuous optogenetic stimulation. Furthermore, gonadal steroids regulate GnRH pulsatile dynamics across the ovarian cycle by altering KNDy neurones' signalling properties. To better understand these mechanisms, we again combine in vivo experiments with mathematical modelling. Our results reconcile previous puzzling findings regarding the estradiol-dependent effect that several neuromodulators have on the GnRH pulse generator dynamics. Therefore, we anticipate our model to be a cornerstone for a more quantitative understanding of the pathways via which gonadal steroids regulate GnRH pulse generator dynamics.

    <EventDescription>The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the primary pacemaker of the heart. SAN activity emerges at an early point in life and maintains a steady rhythm for most of the lifetime of the organism. The emergent activity and long-term stability imply the presence of dynamical feedback control of SAN cell activity. Recent work in the neuroscience field proposed a minimal regulatory model of neuronal ion channel conductance based on [Ca2+]-mediated feedback. This mechanism in brief works as follows: An individual cell tries to match a set intracellular Ca2+ (Cai) target through regulation of ion channel mRNA and subsequent membrane expression levels. If the Cai is below the target, ion channel expression increases, thus leading to higher average Cai. Here, we adapt this regulatory model to the SAN rabbit cell. Our results show that the SAN cell activity can emerge from low starting conductances. As conductances increase, the cell reaches its [Ca2+] target and ion channel conductances reach a steady state. Further, the cells can adapt their activity to different [Ca2+] targets, to outside stimuli such as increased pacing rates, or to ion channel perturbations. In a 2D tissue, combinations of cell-cell coupling and [Ca2+] target ranges lead to heterogeneous ion channel expression and Ca transients, similar to recently published experimental recordings. Thus, the proposed model explains experimental findings with a minimal description of Cai and ion channel regulatory network feedback.

    <EventDescription> Cardiac disease has been a leading cause of death in the US and globally for several years. Many attributes of electrophysiological arrhythmias are caused by the emergent phenomena in three-dimensional tissue. Numerical simulations can help provide mechanistic insight into the formation and termination of arrhythmias. However, numerical solution of the cardiac electrophysiological models in tissue has a high computational cost due to the small spatial resolution demanded by the small size of the cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, the time marching problem is further complicated by the small time-steps required by the steep upstroke of the cardiac action potential. General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) processing has been previously proposed to accelerate the solution of such problems. In this study, the cartesian grid alongside finite differences is proposed to facilitate GPGPU parallelization of 3D cardiac models on realistic structures using WebGL 2.0. We present a compression algorithm which can be used with the cartesian grid to avoid creating a mesh while accurately applying zero-flux boundary conditions. This method can provide higher acceleration compared to other GPGPU implementations. The result is a three-dimensional code that can run close to real-time on personal computers.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Lipid bilayer membranes have a native permeability for water molecules. In the absence of osmolarity, the water flux is often assumed to be negligible. However, we demonstrate that semipermeability can cause large amounts of fluid exchange, even in the absence of osmolarity. We investigate the effects of semipermeability on the hydrodynamics of an inextensible vesicle under mechanical loads caused by an external flow and extreme confinement. Several comparisons are made between impermeable and semipermeable vesicles.

    <EventDescription>Abstract: In this talk, we start with a short summary of several important mathematical results for stochastic travelling waves generated by monostable and bistable reaction-diffusion stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). The aim is to bridge different backgrounds and to identify the most important common principles and techniques currently applied to the analysis of stochastic travelling wave problems. Then we are going to explain a recent result on stochastic pattern formation going beyond travelling waves: stochastic rotating waves generated by SPDEs. We establish two different approaches for stochastic rotating waves, the variational phase and the approximated variational phase, which both help us to compute a stochastic ordinary differential equation (SODE), which describes the effect of noise on neutral spectral modes associated to the special Euclidean symmetry group of rotating waves. Furthermore, we prove transverse stability results for rotating waves showing that over certain time scales and for small noise, the stochastic rotating wave stays close to its deterministic counterpart. Joint work with J. MacLaurin and G. Zucal.

    <EventDescription> Blebs are pressure driven spherical protrusions of the plasma membrane which form when a patch of cell membrane is detached from the cortex and expands under the influence of flowing cytosol. The stabilization of the membrane protrusion is characterized by a complete degradation of the old cortex (actin scar) and the formation of a new cortex beneath the protruded membrane, a process that takes about 20 seconds in \textit{Dictyostelium discoideum} cells.  The mechanism by which the cortex is degraded at the actin scar and simultaneously reformed at the developing bleb boundary is not fully understood. Our recent microscopy data reveals an accumulation of myosin II in the actin scar immediately following the detachment of the membrane and prior to a complete degradation of the actin scar. This accumulation is only present where the membrane is detached from the cortex. Simultaneously, myosin II is enriched at the new bleb boundary at a rate that lags behind the formation of the cortex by about 2 seconds. We hypothesize that myosin accumulation, potentially induced by membrane detachment, contributes to cortical degradation in the actin scar and is delayed in the new bleb boundary to allow the new cortex to stabilize. A mathematical model of actin-myosin dynamics in the actin scar is developed and analyzed to test our hypothesis.

    <EventDescription>Food availability is an important indicator of physiological stress and health in Australian flying fox populations, which in turn are hypothesized to be causal of increased viral shedding and thus increased infectious disease spillover risk. Here we present a machine learning model that classifies time periods of food shortage as a function of climatological and ecological covariates collected from 2005 to 2020 in eastern Australia. By leveraging techniques from explainable artificial intelligence, we identify a reduced set of input features that help explain the variance in the outputs to derive a reduced model with increased prediction accuracy and decreased complexity. We discuss how these results overlap with understanding of flying fox ecology, and how the model might be employed to anticipate periods of food availability and mitigate infectious disease spillover risk.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Rate models for describing the mean-field activities of neuronal ensembles can be used effectively to study network function and dynamics, including synchronization and rhythmicity of excitatory-inhibitory populations. However, traditional Wilson-Cowan-like models, being amenable to math analysis, are found unable to capture some dynamics such as inhibitory network gamma oscillations (ING) although use of an explicit delay can help. 

We resolve this issue by introducing a mean-voltage variable that considers the subthreshold integration of inputs and works as an effective delay in the negative feedback loop between firing rate and synaptic gating of inhibition. I will describe an r-s-v firing rate model for inhibitory networks which is biophysically interpretable and capable of generating ING-like oscillations. Linear stability analysis, numerical branch-tracking and simulations show that the rate model captures many of the common features of spiking network models for ING.

We further extend the framework to excitatory-inhibitory networks. With our 6-variable r-s-v model, we describe the transition from PING to ING by increasing the external drive to the inhibitory population without adjusting synaptic weights. Having PING and ING available in a single network, without invoking synaptic blockers, is beneficial for explaining the emergence and transition of two different types of gamma oscillations. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The incidence of type-2 diabetes (T2D) in the USA has doubled over the past fifteen years and similarly concerning trends are observed around the world. In T2D patients, the body produces the regulatory hormones insulin and glucagon, but their effectiveness has waned to the point where blood glucose levels can get dangerously high. If diagnosed early, T2D can be reversed by changes in life style and diet, while more advanced cases can only be managed, not cured, by drugs like Metformin. Thus, early detection is quintessential. Currently used "gold standard" tests are both invasive (requiring blood samples, fasting or ingesting calibrated amounts of sugar) and inaccurate, threshold values varying from one health organisation to the next. We explore the feasibility of extracting a biomarker for T2D from Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) that subjects can wear while going about their daily routine, effectively replacing few measurement taken under controlled conditions by many taken under normal circumstances. Based on a concise model of homeostatic control and data from various clinic trials, we present a novel biomarker and discuss its accuracy and sensitivity.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>We study a classic Darcy’s law model for tumor cell motion with inhomogeneous and isotropic conductivity. The tumor cells are assumed to be a constant density fluid flowing through porous extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is assumed to be rigid and motionless with constant porosity. One and two dimensional simulations show that the tumor mass grows from
high to low conductivity regions when the tumor morphology is steady. In the one-dimensional case, we proved that when the tumor size is steady, the tumor grows towards lower conductivity regions. We conclude that this phenomenon is produced by the coupling of a special inward flow pattern in the steady tumor and Darcy’s law which gives faster flow speed
in higher conductivity regions.

    <EventDescription>We identify and demonstrate a universal mechanism for terminating
spiral waves in excitable media using an established topological
framework. This mechanism dictates whether high- or low-energy
defibrillation shocks succeed or fail. Furthermore, this mechanism
allows for the design of a single minimal stimulus capable of defibrillating,
at any time, turbulent states driven by multiple spiral waves.
We demonstrate this method in a variety of computational models of
cardiac tissue ranging from simple to detailed human models. The
theory described here shows how this mechanism underlies all successful
defibrillation and can be used to further develop existing and
future low-energy defibrillation strategies.

    <EventDescription>Computational models have struggled to explain the ability of cardiac tissue to, under some circumstances, exhibit small domains of in-phase alternations of action potential durations (APDs), known as discordant alternans, during rapid pacing.  In our study, we demonstrate that, using an improved model of intercell coupling called "ephaptic" coupling, we can readily produce these short-wavelength domains while still maintaining normal wave propagation speeds.  When wavefront propagation from one cell to the next occurs primarily through ephaptic coupling, conduction velocity can be normal, even if gap junction resistances are 100 times the value typically used in simulations. This higher gap junction resistance allows for much lower coupling on the trailing edges of propagating waves, which in turn makes variations in APD over short distances, and therefore short-wavelength discordant alternans, possible.  We find that the gap junctions are still essential in this scenario, but play a supportive, rather than a primary, role.  Our study suggests that ephaptic coupling may be more important than previously thought, both when discordant alternans is present, and possibly, during normal wave propagation as well.

    <EventDescription>Janus particles are widely used for self-assembly of mesoscopic structures with specific functions. We have constructed a model for self-assembly of Janus particles to form bilayer membranes under a hydrophobic potential (SIAM J. Multiscale Modeling, 2020). In the present work, we illustrate the hydrodynamics of a vesicle made of such bilayer membranes. We use boundary integral equations to examine the hydrodynamics under various conditions: a quiescent flow, a planar shear flow, a linear elongation flow, and a Poiseuille flow. The simulation results show strong similarities to the vesicle hydrodynamics of a permeable lipid bilayer membrane and yield flowing conditions such as tank-treading motion, an asymmetric slipper, and membrane rupture. Moreover, the Janus-particle bilayers exhibit intermonolayer slip similar to that for two lipid monolayers and we calculate the friction coefficients.

We study a strong two-component FCH model with a ra- dial symmetric potential which admits a family of quasi-bilayers with various compositional ratios between amphiphile A and B. In the absence of pearling bifurcation, the compositional and geometric evolution of quasi-bilayers de- couples, in the sense that the former evolution takes place in the 1/e time scale when the normal velocity of the interface is still zero. More specifically, the composition ratio satisfies a nonlocal equation accommodating rich dynamics. Depending on the competition between the phase separation and the quenching of the background, the composition ratio evolves into, (1) a homogeneous profile; (2) a phase separation profile where the bilayer consists of pure A regions and pure B regions; or, (3) a quenched profile in a co-dim two manifold. In case (2) and (3), a rapid spatial variation of the composition ratio promotes surface diffusion terms from lower orders. While the evolution of phase separation profiles mimics Allen-Cahn type coarse graining, novel dynamics emerges from the evolution of rapid varying profiles in a neighborhood of the quenched manifold: the compositional pro- file stays nearby the quenching manifold and evolves into a periodic profile with a large period.

    <EventDescription>Wolbachia is a natural bacterium that can infect Aedes mosquitoes and block the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya. Field trials have been conducted worldwide to suppress local epidemics.  We present a new partial differential equation model for the spread of Wolbachia infection in mosquitoes. The model accounts for both the complex Wolbachia vertical transmission cycle and detailed life stages in the mosquitoes, and it also incorporates the spatial heterogeneity created by mosquito dispersion in the two-dimensional release domain. Field trials and previous modeling studies have shown that the fraction of infection among the mosquitoes must exceed a threshold level for the infection to persist. We identify a threshold condition for having a self-sustainable Wolbachia infection in the field. When above this threshold, we also show the model gives rise to a spatial wave of Wolbachia infection.  We quantify how the threshold condition and invasion velocity depend on the diffusion coefficients and other model parameters, and we study different release scenarios to inform the efficient spatial design of the releases.

    <EventDescription>Collective learning and decision-making under various forms of uncertainty is important for animals, humans, and machines. The question of an adequate theoretical foundation for multi-agent learning, however, remains open.

I will present how to efficiently describe the emergent behavior of biologically plausible and parsimonious learning agents faced with partially-observable worlds through a dynamical systems approach, which is formally related to evolutionary game theory. The introduced learning dynamics illustrate that partially observant agents can learn better outcomes faster, in a more stable way, and even overcome social dilemmas. The method also allows the application of dynamical systems theory to partially observable multi-agent learning, as demonstrated by the emergence of catastrophic limit cycles, a critical slowing down of the learning processes, and the separation of the learning dynamics into fast and slow directions, all caused by partial observability. 

The presented approach has the potential to become a practical, lightweight, and robust tool for mathematical researchers working in the fields of biology, social sciences, and machine learning to create insights into collective learning in uncertain and changing environments.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Accurate modeling of molecular interactions is essential for computational studies of biomolecular structure, dynamics, and interactions. To enable chemical accuracy in molecular simulations, we are developing the next-generation classical mechanics potential, AMOEBA+, and related high-performance computing platform. Traditionally classical force fields heavily rely on error cancellations and the separation between electrostatics and other interactions can be arbitrary. By contrast, the AMOEBA+ potential aims to provide not only accurate total interaction energy but also meaningful components of intermolecular forces. The AMOEBA+ potential is established based on systematic investigation of fundamental interatomic forces and ab initio energy decomposition through Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT), as well as a wide range of experimental data. The intermolecular potential energy function includes permanent atomic multipole-based electrostatics, many-body polarization, repulsion, dispersion, charge penetration and transfer contributions. The local valence components are modeled by polynomials or neural networks. All energy and force terms are implemented in the Tinker9 GPU molecular dynamics package. The improvements in AMOEBA+ are crucial for advancing the accuracy and transferability of classical potentials in modeling molecular interactions, realizing the full potential of molecular modeling and design in silico.

    <EventDescription>Cell sensing is fundamentally multi-scale, as information is propagated from molecules to cells to cell groups. I will describe a fascinating sensory mechanism in cancer metastasis where cells use self-guided chemotaxis to follow fluid flows in the body. We derive the limit that diffusive molecular noise places on the precision of this process. Comparing to experiments, we find that cells operate remarkably close to this limit. We then move up in scale to crowded cell populations. We predict a cell density at which this sensory mechanism fails, which agrees with that observed in experiments. Our work elucidates the fundamental limits of sensory biology from the nanometer to millimeter scale.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The standard protocol for studying neuron spiking is to monitor voltage response to the application of current steps. However, a jump in applied current is artificial. A more physiological input is to ramp the applied current to reflect chemosensory input. Unsurprisingly, neurons can respond differently to the protocols since ion channel activation and inactivation are affected differently. The mathematical techniques necessary to analyze and understand the effects of current ramps are under-developed. We demonstrate how current ramps can be analyzed in single neuron models. The primary issue is the presence of gating variables that activate on slow time scales and are far from equilibrium throughout the ramp. The use of fast-slow analysis allows us to understand the neural response to ramps of different slopes. This study is motivated by data from olfactory bulb dopamine neurons, where both fast ramp (tens of milliseconds) and slow ramp (tens of seconds) protocols are used to understand the spiking profiles of the cells. The slow ramps generate experimental bifurcation diagrams with the applied current as a bifurcation parameter, thus establishing asymptotic spiking activity patterns. The faster ramps elicit transient behavior that is of relevance to most physiological inputs, which are short in duration. The two protocols together provide a broader understanding of the neuron’s spiking profile and the role that slowly activating ion channels can play.

    <EventDescription>Diverse interactions among species within bacterial biofilms often lead to intricate spatiotemporal dynamics. The spatial structure of biofilms can determine the growth and survival of different species, but the mechanisms driving formation of these structures are not fully understood. Here, we describe the emergence of complex structures in a biofilm grown from a mixture of motile and non-motile strains of bacteria on a semi-solid agar surface. Time-lapse imaging shows that non-motile bacteria “hitchhike” with the motile bacteria as the latter grow and expand. The non-motile bacteria accumulate at the moving colony boundary and trigger a mechanical instability of the colony boundary that leaves behind striking flower-like patterns. The mechanism of the front instability governing this pattern formation can be elucidated by a mathematical model describing frictional interface motion with friction that depends on the local concentration of the non-motile strain at the interface. We also developed a detailed two-dimensional phase-field model that explicitly accounts for the cell growth and migration driven by self-generated mechanical stresses. Our findings highlight the importance of mechanical interactions in shaping the spatial structure of multi-strain biofilms.

    <EventDescription>The sequence of events by which a eukaryotic cell proceeds through repeated cycles of DNA replication and cell division is controlled by periodic activation and inactivation of a family of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) and auxiliary proteins that regulate CDK activities. The molecular regulatory network is dauntingly complex, confounding efforts to understand its intricate behaviors by intuitive, biochemical reasoning alone. In principle, mathematical simulations of the biochemical reaction network could reliably predict its behavior, but only if we knew beforehand the values of the kinetic rate constants of the underlying reactions…which, of course, we do not. To make sense of this confusion, we have studied the cell-cycle control system by traditional methods of dynamical systems theory, including time-scale separation, bifurcation theory and ‘pseudo’ phase-plane analysis. JJT will show how these methods continue to deliver significant mechanistic insights on current problems of cell physiology.

    <EventDescription>Malaria, a deadly disease caused by protozoan Plasmodium parasites, is spread between humans via the bite of infected adult female Anopheles mosquitoes.  Over 2.5 billion people live in geographies whose local epidemiology permits transmission of P. falciparum, responsible for most of the life-threatening form of malaria.  The widescale and heavy use of insecticide-based interventions, notably long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying), during the period 2000-2015, resulted in a dramatic reduction in malaria incidence and burden in endemic areas, prompting a renewed effort to eradicate the parasitic disease.  Numerous factors, such as Anopheles resistance to all currently-available insecticides, potentially pose important challenges to the eradication efforts.   In this talk, I will discuss a genetic-epidemiology framework for assessing the impact of insecticide resistance on malaria.  Specifically, questions on whether eradication can be achieved using existing insecticide-based control resources will be addressed.

    <EventDescription>Neglected tropical diseases are diseases that affect mainly developing countries and in turn are poorly funded and under researched. Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease that exists primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. This is because the black flies that spread this disease are common to these regions and since these flies bite humans they can infect humans at a noticeable rate. When the black fly bites you it can pass a filarial nematode parasite, called Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted solely by black flies during blood feeding. Some people do not experience symptoms while infected with Onchocerciasis as the larvae can migrate through the human body without provoking a response from the immune system. But many people do have symptoms, which include itchy skin rashes, nodules under the skin, and vision changes Onchocerciasis is currently being treated with ivermectin through mass drug administration. The goal of this project is to find out the optimal way to distribute the treatment to eradicate the disease and to find if the current approach will eventually lead to drug resistance. Our focus was to model this situation and data fit our model to the country of Cameroon. Our research showed that the current treatment plan of Onchocerciasis may never completely eradicate the disease from the population due to resistance. We also found evidence that there may already be resistance in the population.

    <EventDescription>Ecological communities are fundamentally governed by the interactions by individual organisms. These interactions are partially governed by the traits of the organisms, traits which are created and shaped by evolution. As such, integrating evolutionary processes such as natural selection with ecological processes may help us understand ecological communities. One useful framework that seamlessly integrates ecology and evolution is evolutionary game theory. In evolutionary game theory, individual organisms use their adaptations as strategies to achieve ecological objectives and receive a fitness payoff. Beyond interactions between individual organisms, evolutionary game theory can be used to model eco-evolutionary dynamics in and of multispecies ecological communities. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how using evolutionary game theory can help us to understand properties of multispecies communities. Using evolutionary game theory, we can generate in silico communities and compare their structure and properties to real ecological communities like niche packing, coexistence, nestedness, rank abundance, and average interaction strength. We can also explore how these measures change with shifting environmental conditions by analyzing the resulting evolutionary pressures. I present work that I have done and am currently doing on this topic and speculate on evolutionary game theory’s utility in understanding ecological communities.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Multiscale modeling of microtubule binding domain to microtubule

Electrostatic interactions dominate other interactions in molecular biology because practically all atoms carry partial charge while being situated at Angstroms distances, thus resulting in large electrostatic force and energies. Furthermore, the electrostatic force is a long-range force and thus is very important not to be truncated since many biological phenomena involve binding of proteins to a large object. Because the electrostatic forces that guide binding act over large distances, one should consider the contribution of atoms situated at large distances. Here we report a multiscale approach that implements a computational focusing method that permits computation of large systems without truncating the electrostatic potential and achieves the high resolution required for modeling macromolecular interactions, all while keeping the computational time reasonable. We tested our approach on the motility of various kinesin motor domains. We found that electrostatics help guide kinesins as they walk: N-kinesins towards the plus-end, and C-kinesins towards the minus-end of microtubules. Our methodology enables computation in similar, large systems including protein binding to DNA, viruses, and membranes.

    <EventDescription>During foraging, animals decide how long to stay and harvest reward, and then abandon that site and travel with a certain speed to the next reward opportunity. One aspect of this behavior involves decision-making, while the other involves motor-control. A recent theory posits that control of decision-making and movements may be linked via a desire to maximize a single normative utility: the sum of all rewards acquired, minus all efforts expended, divided by time. If this is the case, then the history of reward, and not just its immediate availability, should dictate how long one decides to stay and harvest reward, and how slowly one travels to the next opportunity. We tested this theory in a series of experiments in which humans used their hand to harvest tokens at a reward patch, and then used their arm to reach toward a subsequent opportunity. Following a history of poor rewards, people not only foraged for a longer period, but also moved slower to the next reward site. Thus, reward history had a consistent effect on both the decision-making process regarding when to abandon a reward site, and the motor control process regarding how fast to move to the next opportunity.

    <EventDescription>The ability to collaborate with different types of unseen human teammates is crucial for artificial agents to be effective in human-agent teams (HATs).  On one hand, individual human difference and complicated team dynamics makes it difficult to develop a one-size-fits-all agent policy a priori.  On the other hand, developing agent models in HATs that consider human individual variation is challenging and has not been well studied.  This talk describes research into both human-human and human-agent teams in Coop Space Fortress, a dyadic cooperative task with an adversary and heterogeneous player roles.  Results for human-human teams demonstrate that team performance is influenced by both players’ individual skill level, as well as their ability to collaborate with different team mates by adopting complementary policies.  An agent team member was developed for the Coop Space Fortress scenario which employs a library of diverse agent policies developed using a mixture of learning approaches, and a novel similarity metric is used to select a complementary agent policy based on inference of human policy.  The combination of the policy library and similarity metric allows the agent to adapt in real-time to new human team members.  Experimental results demonstrate the contributions of adaptation in both human-human and human-agent team experiments.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cellular motility is essential for many (patho)physiological processes, including immune responses, embryonic development and cancer metastasis. The two members of the Rho-family of GTPases, Rac1 and RhoA, have been implicated in defining the key signaling motif responsible for generating cellular polarity and directionality through their mutual inhibition. Their spatiotemporal dynamics are partially regulated by the phosphorylation of an adaptor protein called Paxillin. A 6D partial differential equation model describing the interactions of these proteins, along with other auxiliary proteins, was previously developed by our group to decipher their role in generating bistability between uninduced (active Rho) and induced (active Rac) states, as well as wave-pinning underlying cellular polarization. We have recently simplified this model into an excitable 3D model possessing three different time scales. The new model produced not only bistability and wave-pinning, but also relaxation oscillations (ROs) and mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs). Simulating the dynamics of this model using the cellular potts model produced outcomes in which protrusions in cell membrane changed localization, resulting in membrane oscillations and fast directionality variations similar to those seen in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Performing slow-fast analysis revealed that dynamic Hopf and canards are responsible for generating ROs and MMOs. In this talk, I will provide a summary of these findings.

    <EventDescription>We investigate transitions to simple dynamics in first-order nonlinear differential equations with multiple delays. With a proper choice of parameters, a single delay can destabilize a fixed point, a common mechanism that leads to oscillatory and even chaotic behaviour in physiological systems. The distributed delay case corresponds to an infinite number of delays, and is known to typically yield solutions of relatively lesser complexity, all other parameters being equal. We focus on the intermediate regimes of multiple discrete delays, embodying many parallel feedback pathways. The dynamics are found to depend on the precise distribution of the delays in mixed feedback systems. A narrow spacing between delays induces chaotic behaviour, but a larger spacing (lower delay density) promotes a collapse in complexity towards stable periodic or fixed point behaviour. The behaviour of the unstable characteristic roots around the fixed point exhibits an astonishing parallel with that of the Lyapunov exponents and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy for these multi-delay systems, and thus serves as a proxy of solution complexity. Inverse period-doubling can also occur as the number of delays increases beyond a threshold that depends on the separation of time scales, namely between the mean delay and the intrinsic response time.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cancer cells can forego using available oxygen in favor of less efficient glycolytic (GLY) metabolism. This is a hallmark of cancer known as the Warburg effect. As a by-product, this GLY pathway increases tumor acidity which can help the cancer cells out-compete healthy tissue and increase vasculature (angiogenesis). Prior work modeled acidity and vasculature as public or club goods, but did not explicitly track the acidity and amount of vasculature. Our evolutionary game theoretic model explicitly represents these environmental feedbacks as dynamic variables ($a(t)$ for acidity and $v(t)$ for vasculature) alongside the distribution of strategies ($x(t)$ for proportion of GLY cells). The relative fitness of the two strategies (oxidative phosphorylation vs GLY) is determined by competition at the level of metabolic rates and efficiencies due to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of ATP production. This leads to non-linear fitness functions for the two strategies, allowing the system to have dynamic regimes with several interior fixed-points. We classify the number and stability of fixed-points based on the initial amount of vasculature and metabolic parameters. In particular, we note the importance of lower uptake rates of glucose in the GLY cells for maintaining a less dangerous non-glycolytic tumor. We hope that our model of in situ pre-metastatic neoplasms gives insights into early tumor progression and potential avenues for cancer treatment and prevention.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Electrostatics plays a significant role in bimolecular structure, interaction, and dynamics. However, due to its long range and pairwise natures, consideration of electrostatics is often challenging in accuracy and computational cost. In this talk, we present a novel efficient and accurate approach to include electrostatics into the framework of topological network for predicting protein binding affinities. The simulation results demonstrate the significance of involving electrostatics.

    <EventDescription>Skeletal muscle is a complex and heterogeneous biological material that is important for both movement and structure. A unique aspect of muscle is its ability to activate and produce force. Many properties of muscle can influence the amount of force produced during activation, including muscle composition and volume. Muscle consists of muscle fibers embedded in a matrix of collagen fibers, and this structure can be substantially influenced by muscular diseases. For instance, cerebral palsy (CP) is a disorder resulting from an upper motor neuron lesion in the brain and can affect muscle in several ways, such as altering the microstructural properties, increasing fat infiltration, and changing the whole muscle architecture. In this work, we develop a mathematical model for skeletal muscle that can capture the influence of CP on the mechanics of skeletal muscle. We capture the muscle mechanics using a finite-strain nonlinearly elastic continuum model of a fiber reinforced composite with the activation in the along-fiber direction. To include the effects of CP into the model, we utilize experimental data obtained with MRI. The experimental data gives realistic muscle geometries to understand the effects of CP on the muscle architecture, as well as information about the material composition including the volume fraction of fat. This study combines mathematical, clinical, and experimental work to produce a comprehensive model to better understand how CP influences muscle mechanics.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Cytoskeletal contraction is central for cell motility, division, and intracellular transport. This contraction is generated by myosin in dynamically cross-linked viscoelastic actin networks. Experiments of our collaborators show that cell extracts encapsulated in water-in-oil droplets self-organize to form actomyosin networks that contract and flow for hours. In small droplets, these systems exhibit a dynamic steady-state characterized by radially symmetric inward flow. As the droplet size increases, the networks transition to a state of contractile waves or spirals.
Motivated by these experiments, we developed a model of the actomyosin network as a compressible, viscous fluid governed by reaction-transport and force balance equations; the latter is nontrivial as this is an active fluid with density-dependent stresses. Analysis and numerical simulation demonstrate that our model successfully reproduces key experimental results. We capture the size-dependent transition from continuous contraction to waves and how this transition depends on contraction rate. Our model also predicts waves with periods which are roughly size-independent. These results shed light on the mechanics of cell waves and contractions.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Enhanced spontaneous contraction of the urinary bladder smooth muscle (UBSM) is associated with overactive bladder (OAB), a pathophysiological syndrome that affects millions of individuals. The anticholinergic drug "Oxybutynin", used for OAB, causes several side effects such as dry mouth, complications in visual functions and constipation. Therefore, the current research is focused to identify alternative pathways with the potential to reduce DSM contractility for the treatment of OAB.  Recently, transient receptor potential melastatin-4 (TRPM4) channels have been identified in regulating DSM cell excitability which is the aim of this study. We have used a mathematical model to describe the AP to help us understand the role of ion channels. In this model, the TRPM4 channel current (Itrp) is computed upon the steady-state values of the activation and inactivation parameters.  All ionic conductance were tuned to set the resting membrane potential (RMP) at - 50 mV and  maximum conductance was set to 0.00001 mho/cm2. As the value of maximum conductance is increased, the DSM cell model generates AP with the higher RMP value. After increasing the maximum conductance to 0.0001 mho/cm2, the simulated AP showed a more depolarized RMP value. This simulation showed that the activation of more TRPM channels will cause OAB by increasing the excitability of DSM cells. Hence, TRPM4 channel blocker 9-phenanthrol may play a novel approach for the treatment of bladder overactivity.

    <EventDescription>The Arctic is the fastest warming region on Earth. Understanding how a rapidly changing climate change impacts Arctic systems is therefore an important challenge. This is the basis of the `Compost-Bomb' instability, a theorized runaway heating of northern latitude peat soils when atmospheric temperature rises faster than some critical rate, first proposed in [Luke &amp; Cox, European Journal of Soil Science (2011), 62.1] and analysed in [Wieczorek et al, Proceedings of the Royal Society A (2011), 467.2129]. The Compost Bomb instability was one of the first examples of what is known as Rate-induced tipping or R-tipping.

The key trigger for the compost bomb instability is heat produced by microbial respiration. Here, the original soil carbon and temperature model of Luke &amp; Cox is augmented with a non-monotone microbial respiration function, for a more realistic representation of the process. This gives rise to a meta-stable state, reproducing the results of [Khvorostyanov et al, Tellus (2008), 60B] where a complex PDE model is used. Two non-autonomous climate forcings are examined: (i) a rise in mean air temperature over decades (ii) a short-lived extreme weather event, with the rate-induced compost bomb observed in each. Using techniques of compactification, singular perturbation theory and desingularisation, we reduce the R-tipping problem to one of heteroclinic orbits, uncovering the tipping mechanism for each climate change scenario.

    <EventDescription>Over a three to four-fold range of oxygen demand, the human left-ventricular myocardium extracts roughly 80\% of the oxygen delivered via the coronary blood supply. Thus, to maintain adequate oxygenation, myocardial blood flow must vary in proportion to changes in oxygen demand that occur, for example, during exercise. We have constructed multi-scale models of myocardial mitochondrial energy metabolism, myofibril cross-bridge kinetics and myocyte mechanics, whole-heart pumping mechanics, ventricular-vascular interactions governing myocardial perfusion, and whole-body cardiopulmonary blood flow accounting for autonomic control of vascular tone and cardiac inotropy and chronotropy. Integrating these model components together, we are able to simulate the in vivo relationships between myocardial power output, ATP demand, oxygen consumption, blood flow, and transmural regional perfusion in exercise. The integrated whole-body model is validated based on its ability to predict emergent features, such as maximum heart rate, maximal cardiac power output, and the oxygen cost of stroke work. The validated model is used to analyze an interpret data on in vivo myocardial perfusion in a large-animal model of heart failure and to identify and refine hypothesized mechanisms underlying microvascular dysfunction in this model. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Glycemic management (GM) in ICU is a hard job and requires lots of attention from clinicians. Although non-diabetic, most ICU patients need exogenous insulin to control their blood glucose (BG) levels. Currently, clinicians follow a flow chart to adjust the exogenous intravenous (IV) insulin rates. Using mechanistic modeling-based control approaches for GM as a clinical decision support tool would enhance the GM results by reducing the burden on clinicians.

The glucose-insulin system of ICU patients is highly non-stationary because of their health conditions and interventions. Also, BG measurements are routinely collected every 1-3 hours, providing at most 15 measurements per day. Moreover, insulin, a central system component besides BG, is rarely measured. These constraints lead us to build a model as simple as possible, still capturing the physiologic behavior of the system and useful for BG forecasting and control in the ICU. For this purpose, we developed a stochastic model consisting of two parts: the deterministic component modeling the mean behavior of BG levels and the stochastic component accounting for the variation in BG levels due to unresolvable dynamics with the deterministic part. The model output is a stochastic process providing the mean behavior and its uncertainty; the possible lowest and highest BG levels.

We use this model to estimate the optimal IV insulin rate to keep BG levels in the target range with a linear quadratic Gaussian controller.

    <EventDescription>A careful observation of the number of flowers flowering in an individual plant of passion flower (\textit{Passiflora incarnata}) revealed temporal oscillations with a period of approximately 30 days. A follow up study including four plants revealed synchronous pulsed flowering in the system. These oscillations do not seem to depend directly upon external factors like temperature, humidity, and sunlight. Therefore, it is concluded that they must be dependent on internal factors like flower inducing florigen and anti-florigen. A modified Lotka model is used to account for the observed oscillations in flowering in the system. 

A closer examination of individual flowers reveals interesting concentric circular patterns that are violet in color.  Following the study of the onset of colors in individual fibrils, the pattern formation in these flowers is explained using an activator-inhibitor model of Gierer and Meinhardt that involves diffusion and autocatalytic and inhibitory steps.

    <EventDescription>Due to their shape, some aneurysms and left atrial appendages (LAA) represent a favorable environment for stagnant flow circulation and potential blood clotting. The factors contributing to clot formation in these areas remain poorly understood due to the complexity of the
coagulation system and the lack of appropriate experimental models. To address this question, we develop a novel multiphase continuum framework that describes the interplay between platelet aggregation, blood biorheology, and plasma coagulation. After validating the model against known benchmarks, we conduct numerical simulations to elucidate the effects of morphology, flow intensity and red blood cells on the structure and size of the formed thrombi in aneurysms. We show that high-hematocrit, low neck size, and slower flow intensity are all important factors contributing to the pathogenesis of thrombi in aneurysms. After that, we adapt the same model to study clot formation in patient-specific geometries of the left atrial appendage during atrial fibrillation. We discuss how numerical simulations can be used to estimate the risk of clot formation in patients with atrial fibrillation.

    <EventDescription>Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated, over the recent years, impressive clinical response in cancer patients, but some patients do not respond at all to checkpoint blockade, exhibiting primary resistance. Primary resistance to PD-1 blockade is reported to occur under conditions of immunosuppressive tumor environment, a condition caused by myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and by T cells exclusion, due to increased level of T regulatory cells (Tregs). The present paper introduces two cancer-specific parameters and, correspondingly, develops a mathematical model which explains how primary resistance to PD-1 blockade occurs, in terms of the two cancer-specific parameters, and how, in combination with anti-TGF-$\beta$, anti-PD-1 provides significant benefits; these parameters may serve as predictive biomarkers. The model is represented by a system of partial differential equations and the simulations are in agreement with the recent mice experiments. The mathematical model also predicts that hyperprogression diseases may be reversed by combining anti-TGF-$\beta$ to anti-PD-1. The model can be used to evaluate the efficacy of different protocols in combination therapy with PD-1 and TGF-$\beta$ inhibitors. In particular, it is demonstrated that combined therapy may either decrease or increase tumor growth depending on the two cancer-specific parameters and the amount of, and the ratio between, the two drugs.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In this talk, we discuss the global existence and uniqueness and long-time behavior for solutions to a repulsive chemotaxis model with logarithmic sensitivity and logistic growth. In particular, we establish global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the corresponding initial value problem with Neumann boundary conditions, as well as demonstrate asymptotic convergence to constant states of the corresponding population and chemical concentration densities. Time permitting, we additionally discuss results concerning the vanishing chemical diffusivity limit.

    <EventDescription>When making decisions, we often rely on a mix of information that we have acquired individually and information that is commonly available. Neglecting the effect of social information exchange, does the fact of information being individual or common affect the quality of the decisions we make? To answer this question we assume that multiple non-interacting agents make observations and decide between two options when they gathered sufficient information to reach one of two symmetric thresholds. Some observations are made in common by all agents and some privately by each agent. Common observations result in the first agents to reach threshold being less likely to make the correct choice compared to when all observations are private. We observe this phenomenon even when private and common observations are equally informative. Therefore, it is only the order of a decision that impacts its accuracy. Indeed, later deciders become progressively more accurate, and last deciders will be more accurate than those using only private information.  We explain this counterintuitive observation, and conclude that access to common information increases accuracy for those with uninformative or contradictory early information and decreases accuracy for those whose early private information coincides with the common information.

    <EventDescription>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation in the beta-hemoglobin chain which results in hemoglobin polymerization. In turn, polymerization events lead to red blood cell (RBC) sickling and hemolysis triggering a cascade of inflammatory signals and endothelial cell activations (ECs). Neutrophil and RBC aggregation on ECs can lead to vaso-occlusions, obstructing blood flow within the micro-vasculatures. Vaso-occlusion is a major pathologic consequence of SCD as it can further lead to hypoxia, acute/long-term organ damages, and pain crisis.

An important component of the development of vaso-occlusion is the role of fluid/blood flow and biophysical aspects of cell-cell interaction specifically through mediation by the selectin family of cell surface receptors. Our project focuses on developing a quantitative systems pharmacology model that computationally tracks the formation of vaso-occlusion in SCD. Our model consists of a system of partial differential equations that incorporates the effects of cell-cell interactions (neutrophils, RBCs, and ECs), blood flow, and biochemical reactions, on the formation of cellular aggregates in vaso-occlusion. The model will be used to investigate the vital roles of selectins as therapeutic targets for the treatment of SCD. We will quantitatively and mechanistically link the relationship between the circulating biomarkers and disease risk factors with an aim of aiding the design and development of future therapies for SCD.

    <EventDescription>Current drugs used to treat abnormalities in cardiac rhythm, or arrhythmia, often lack therapeutic efficacy and have significant side effects. Difficulty in connecting molecular drug interactions to patient phenotypes is due to nonlinear and stochastic behaviors that drive emergent cardiac phenomena. This challenge is further exacerbated by the limited experimental availability of healthy human cardiac cells and tissues, requiring suboptimal animal model surrogates. Amiodarone is an example of a widely prescribed but poorly understood therapy. Its mechanistic complexity, which includes time dependence and different modes of block, could be elucidated with detailed computational models. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) treated with amiodarone were analyzed using automated planar patch clamp (single cells/currents) or optical fluorescence microscopy (confluent monolayers) to assess drug response. These data and literature parameters were integrated into a computational ventricular myocyte model to create drug models based on either hiPSC-CM or animal model amiodarone electrophysiology. Virtual cardiomyocyte cables treated with a therapeutic dose of hiPSC-CM- and animal-parameterized amiodarone exhibited differential impacts on action potential and calcium transient morphology. Our ability to identify these discrepancies may inform the translation of drug response in hiPSC-CMs and animal models to adult human multiscale electrophysiology.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Electrical bursting oscillations in neurons and endocrine cells are activity patterns that facilitate the secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones, and have been the focus of study for several decades. Mathematical modeling has been an extremely useful tool in this effort, and the use of fast-slow analysis has made it possible to understand bursting from a dynamic perspective, and to make testable predictions about changes in system parameters or the cellular environment. It is typically the case that the electrical impulses that occur during the active phase of a burst are due to stable limit cycles in the fast subsystem of equations, or in the case of so-called ``pseudo-plateau bursting', canards that are induced by a folded node singularity. In this paper, we show an entirely different mechanism for bursting that relies on stochastic opening and closing of a key ion channel. We demonstrate, using fast-slow analysis, how the short-lived stochastic channel openings can yield a much longer response in which single action potentials are converted into bursts of action potentials. Without this stochastic element, the system is incapable of bursting. This mechanism can describe stochastic bursting in pituitary corticotrophs, which are small cells that exhibit a great deal of noise, as well as other pituitary cells such as lactotrophs and somatotrophs that exhibit noisy bursts of electrical activity.

    <EventDescription>In order to limit the disease burden and economic costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to understand how effective and widely distributed a vaccine must be in order to have a beneficial impact on public health. To evaluate the potential effect of a vaccine, we developed risk equations for the daily risk of COVID-19 infection both currently and after a vaccine becomes available. Our risk equations account for the basic transmission probability of COVID-19 ($\beta$) and the lowered risk due to various protection options: physical distancing; face coverings such as masks, goggles, face shields or other medical equipment; handwashing; and vaccination. We found that the outcome depends significantly on the degree of vaccine uptake: if uptake is higher than 80\%, then the daily risk can be cut by 50\% or more. However, if less than 40\% of people get vaccinated and other protection options are abandoned --- as may well happen in the wake of a COVID-19 vaccine --- then introducing even an excellent vaccine will produce a worse outcome than our current situation. It is thus critical that effective education strategies are employed in tandem with vaccine rollout.

    <EventDescription>Many epidemiological models assume an exponentially-distributed waiting time in each of the population classes in order to simplify the model formulation and its analysis. This may not always be the most accurate assumption depending on context, and some methods have been developed to account for the variability in class waiting times such as the linear chain trick. It is especially important to capture the correct waiting times in models dealing with pharmacological responses due to treatment in order to better understand the interaction between drug concentration and pathogen load within hosts. Capturing these interactions can help us model the within-human pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics which will then enable us to inform drug development and treatment in human populations. It will also help us reduce the spread of drug-resistant strains. We will present a two-strain SITR integral equation model for Malaria that incorporates general waiting time distributions and explore the treatment-related parameters and their relationship with population disease dynamics. </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Simulating Microbial Behaviors in Physically Relevant Environments

As biological machines, bacteria can exhibit a broad spectrum of processes ranging from petrochemical degradation to human health maladies which make them agents of interest across several bioengineering disciplines. While modern profiling tools have greatly advanced interrogations into how these processes emerge in bacteria, approaches to elicit specific responses from a bacteria population in situ remain difficult to achieve. The seminal work from Keller and Segel has demonstrated that a population’s motility behaviors can be mathematically modelled and even predicted under certain stimuli. In this presentation, I will report the work accomplished by the Ford Group in applying similar models to predict microbial responses inside settings that mimic physical environments. First, I will illustrate how the Keller-Segel system can be expanded in order to interrogate bacteria motility behaviors in chemically heterogenous spaces. Second, I will discuss our investigations into how external porous media conditions influence a bacterium’s navigational capabilities as well as how these factors translate back into the continuum perspective. Lastly, I will describe our extension of bacterial transport in porous media into the biomedical discipline in order to influence the progression of pathogenic infections.

    <EventDescription>Modeling thrombus growth in pathological flows allows evaluation of risk under patient-specific pharmacological, hematological, and hemodynamical conditions. We have developed a 3D multiscale simulation framework for the prediction of thrombus growth under flow on a spatially resolved surface presenting collagen and tissue factor. The multiscale framework is composed of four coupled modules: a Neural Network (NN) that accounts for platelet signaling, a Lattice Kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC) simulation for tracking platelet positions, a Finite Volume Method (FVM) simulator for solving equations describing agonist release and transport, and a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) flow solver for computing the blood flow field over the growing thrombus. Computationally efficient parallel simulations were achieved by using open-source software where applicable: Palabos (LB), OpenFOAM (FVM), and Multiscale Universal Interface for module-coupling. Parallel versions of LKMC and NN were achieved by employing a novel parallel platelet-decomposition approach. The model accurately captured the evolution of the growing thrombus observed in microfluidics experiments of whole blood perfusion with various antiplatelet agents. The generalizability of the 3D model enabled simulations of important clinical situations, such as cylindrical blood vessels and stenoses. Overall, the approach allows consideration of patient-specific platelet signaling and vascular geometry for the prediction of thrombotic episodes.

    <EventDescription>There are two main structures which cells use to migrate, blebs and F-actin driven pseudopods. Blebs are spherical protrusions of the cell memberane driven in-part by intracellular fluid pressure while pseudopods use rapid polymerization of actin to move the membrane forward. Depending on their environment, cells are able to switch between movement with F-actin and blebs . While F-actin driven pseudopods have been well characterized, there are still a lot of open questions about the physical and chemical mechanisms that regulate bleb-driven motility. Of particular interest is the translation of mechanochemical cues into coordinated movement. The focus of our research is to use mathematical modeling and computer simulation to clarify the underlying mechanisms that drive blebbing. In this work, we present preliminary efforts to model the expansion of blebs in confined \textit{Distyostelium discoideum} cells using the level set framework to guide shape changes.

    <EventDescription>Synchronization of neural activity in the gamma frequency band is associated with various cognitive phenomena. Abnormalities of gamma synchronization may underlie symptoms of several disorders. Properties of oscillations are known to depend on the synaptic properties of circuits expressing this activity. This study explores how synaptic properties affect the fine temporal patterning of neural synchrony. If two signals show only moderate synchrony strength, it may be possible to consider these dynamics as moving in between synchronized and desynchronized states. We use connected networks expressing pyramidal-interneuronal gamma (PING) to explore the temporal patterning of synchronized and desynchronized intervals. Synaptic strength changes may alter the temporal patterning of synchronized dynamics even if the average synchrony strength is not changed. Larger values of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses between excitatory and inhibitory neurons tend to promote short desynchronizations; stronger synapses between inhibitory interneurons tend to promote longer desynchronizations. Furthermore, circuits with different patterning of synchronization in time may have different sensitivity to synaptic input. Thus, the alterations of synaptic strength may mediate physiological properties of neural circuits not only via change in the average synchrony level of gamma oscillations, but also via change in how synchrony is patterned in time over very short time scales.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In this work we study the level of synchronization in stochastic biochemical reaction networks that
support stable mean-field limit cycles and are subject to common external switching noise. Synchronization in stochastic limit cycle oscillators due to common noise is usually demonstrated by
applying Ito’s lemma to the logarithm of the phase difference. However, this argument cannot be
straightforwardly extended to our case because of its discrete state space. Assuming the intrinsic and
extrinsic noises operate at different time scales, we prove that the average level of synchronization
is of the order of the rate of the intrinsic noise (inversely proportional to the system volume) times
the square of the switching rate of the external noise. Moreover, we show in numerical experiments
the approximate asymptotic value of the synchronization level by applying this result to classical
oscillators found in the literature.

    <EventDescription>The effects of noise on the dynamics of nonlinear systems is known to lead to many counterintuitive
behaviors. Using simple planar limit cycle oscillators, we show that the addition of moderate noise leads to
qualitatively different dynamics. In particular, the system can appear bistable, rotate in the opposite
direction of the deterministic limit cycle, or cease oscillating altogether. Utilizing standard techniques from
stochastic calculus and recently developed stochastic phase reduction methods, we elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the different dynamics and verify our analysis with the use of numerical
simulations. Last, we show that similar bistable behavior is found when moderate noise</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Immunotherapy has potential for treating chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus. Effectiveness of therapy may depend on intrinsic host immune factors and on the state of the infection within the host. We employ a mechanistic model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and Interleukin-15 (IL-15) agonist therapy to identify factors influencing IL-15 efficacy in two non-human primate cohorts. One cohort previously controlled SIV without treatment (controllers), and IL-15 therapy temporarily restored this control. The other cohort had no history of control (non-controllers) and saw no consistent viral suppression with IL-15 therapy. The model is separately calibrated to each cohort using plasma viral load and peripheral blood CD8+ T cell data. Bayesian uncertainty quantification is used to compare parameter values and model predictions between the two cohorts. Notably, higher levels of pre-treatment CD8+ T cell activation in the non-controllers contribute to the reduced effectiveness of IL-15, as there is less potential for increased activation. This aspect is qualitatively validated by additional experimental data. The immune-dampening response to IL-15-induced inflammation is also distinct between the cohorts, as is the growth rate of the virus. Our mathematical model could inform which infection states and host conditions would most benefit from IL-15-based immunotherapies.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Bacterial swimming mediated by flagellar rotation is one of the most ubiquitous forms of cellular locomotion, and it plays a major role in many biological processes. A typical swimming path of flagellated bacteria looks like a random walk with no purpose, but the random movement becomes modified as environmental conditions change. Modified random movement is particularly characterized by their motility pattern or a combination of their swimming modes. Further, such individual swimming patterns characterize the collective behavior of a population of the bacteria. In this talk, we present several distinct motility patterns exhibited by bacterial species. We also discuss how to analyze the collective behavior of bacteria from the individual swimming pattern, particularly, by using an example of E. coli’s swimming behavior in response to chemical signals.

    <EventDescription>We will present results on the spatial dynamics of COVID-19 in Andalusia, Spain using two distinct modeling approaches. First, we will report on a PDE-based model of the spread during the first wave of the pandemic (spring of 2020).  Time-varying transmission and diffusion coefficients are incorporated to account for the mitigation measures imposed during the period we consider. Then, we will show results on a metapopulation model for the period before the second wave (summer and early fall of 2020). No mobility restrictions were in effect during this period, so we incorporate data-driven population flows among the eight provinces. These mobility flows are time-dependent due to weekend travel and for other reasons. One of our main findings is that the trends observed in the reported data cannot be reproduced by models without human mobility.  We will conclude the talk with ideas for future directions and alternative ways to analyze the reported data.

    <EventDescription>
The transmission dynamics of HIV are closely tied to the duration and overlap of sexual 
partnerships. There are many issues at play. A serodiscordant long-term partnership presents repeated exposures to the infected partner. If concurrency exists, an increase in partnership duration can increase infection rates. However, non-infected monogamous pairs are protected.  We develop an autonomous population model that can account for the possibilities of an infection from either a casual sexual partner or a long-term partner who was either infected at the
start of the partnership or was newly infected. The impacts of the long-term
partnerships on the rate of infection are captured by calculating the expected
values of the rate of infection from these extended contacts. The model has three stages of infectiousness: acute, chronic, and virally suppressed. We calculate HIV incidence and the fraction of new infections attributed to casual contacts and long-term partnerships allowing
for variability in the condom usage, the effect of achieving and maintaining viral suppression, and early intervention by beginning HAART during the acute phase of infection. We present our results using data on MSM HIV transmission from the CDC in the U.S.  While the acute stage is the most infectious, most of the new infections will be transmitted by long-term partners in the chronic stage when condom use is infrequent.

    <EventDescription>Cocaine addiction is a psychosocial disorder induced by the chronic use of cocaine and causes a large of number deaths around the world. Despite decades of effort, no drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Cocaine dependence is neurological and involves many interacting proteins in the interactome. Among them, the dopamine (DAT), serotonin (SERT), and norepinephrine (NET) transporters are three major targets. Each of these targets has a large protein-protein interaction (PPI) network which must be considered in the anti-cocaine addiction drug discovery. Our work presents DAT, SERT, and NET interactome network-informed machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) studies of cocaine addiction. We collected and analyzed 61 protein targets out of 460 proteins in the DAT, SERT, and NET PPI networks that have sufficiently large existing inhibitor datasets. Utilizing autoencoder (AE) and other ML/DL algorithms, we built predictive models for these targets to predict the potential of drug repurposing potentials and possible side effects.  We further screened their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties to search for leads having potential for developing treatments for cocaine addiction. Our approach offers a new systematic protocol for artificial intelligence (AI)-based anti-cocaine addiction lead discovery.

    <EventDescription>The aim of this paper is to introduce persistent sheaf Laplacians (PSLs) as an extension of persistent Laplacian theory to cellular sheaves.   
This work is motivated by the need to elegantly fuse geometric and non-geometric information. The geometric shape can be successfully captured by persistent topology, while local non-geometric properties requires additional treatment. Cellular sheaves offer an ideal tool for this task. 
Recall that the theory of persistent Laplacian theory provides us a  workflow to study a point cloud
(1) generates a filtration of simplical complexes;
(2) builds a persistence module of simplicial chain complexes; and
(3) calculates persistent Laplacians and their spectra.
We modify the second workflow and define the notion of PSLs for a persistent module of sheaf cochain complexes.
Given a point cloud with nonzero real number associated to each point, we first generate a Rips complex or alpha complex filtration, and define a sheaf for each simplicial complex in the filtration. These sheaves will give rise to a persistent module of sheaf cochain complexes.
Given a persistence module of sheaf cochain complexes, one can calculate PSLs, just as one can calculate persistent Laplacians for a persistent module of simplicial chain complexes. 
The spectra of PSLs can be used in the same way as persistent Laplacians.

    <EventDescription>Localized regions of persistent cortical neural activity have been repeatedly validated as a neural substrate of parametric working memory. Anatomical evidence suggests these activity bumps can represent the continuous location of a cue location over several seconds. Continuous bump attractor models can represent such activity, linking neural dynamics to behavioral inaccuracies observed in memory recall. Both pyramidal (excitatory) and interneuronal (inhibitory) subpopulations exhibit tuned bumps of activity. However, many models collapse these into a single joint excitatory/inhibitory population, and do not consider the role of spatial cross-population noise. In our study, we separate excitatory/inhibitory neural populations and leverage asymptotic analysis to understand how network architecture and noise correlations shape stochastic bump movement. We observed that features of the inhibitory bump profile affect the stability and diffusion of the excitatory bump. Additionally, correlated noise across the two populations generally decreases diffusion of the bumps. A separate inhibitory population and noise correlations can greatly influence memory of initial conditions in the excitatory subpopulation. Finally, the nonmonotonic trends observed in our results indicate that memory diffusion may be further minimized by tuning parameters of neural architecture or considering a more detailed account of excitatory/inhibitory interactions.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The migration of clustered border cells in recent experiments and modeling shows variable progression.  Rotation, pausing, acceleration all are characteristics of wild-type migration.  Genetic mutations can further alter any suggestion of a smooth uniform progression.  We construct a minimal model for the transmembrane Receptor Tyrosine Kinases RTK as they respond to the chemicals secreted from the oocyte in a reduced geometrical setting to show how recycling of receptors can allow the cluster to adapt to chemical gradients that are sometimes dramatic.

    <EventDescription>The interactions between biological systems and engineered nanomaterials has become an important area of study due to recent applications of nanomaterials in medical applications. Mathematical modeling of nanoparticles (NPs) for cancer treatment can be used to explore NP, cell, tissue, and anti-cancer agent response parameters for a growing tumor, allowing for designers to see the impact of their design choices. 

In this work, we propose an agent-based model (with \emph{PhysiCell}. Ghaffarizadeh et al. (2018). DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991) of mRNA vaccine-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for cancer immunotherapy. The model is extended by a cancer nanotherapy model (https://nanohub.org/resources/pc4nanobio) and multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.019075). The nano-immunotherapy model is used to perform explorations of activation and immune response through exploring tumor cell growth, LNP-dendritic cell interactions (LNP binding dynamics, intracellular mRNA message translation dynamics), activation of immune systems (recruitment of CD8+, CD4+ T cells and antibody), and interactions between CD8+ T cells, antibody, and tumor cells. The model of this work can be run on a cloud-hosted platform at: https://nanohub.org/resources/mrnatumor.

    <EventDescription>This project presents zero-dimensional computer models for blood flow in the context of spaceflight, focusing on launch and landing. In contrast to previous attempts at first-principle modeling of the cardiovascular system’s behavior during spaceflight have emphasized the circulation in microgravity or post-spaceflight orthostasis. Our methodologies consist of a steady-state model that considers averaged values for physiological parameters and a multi-compartmental pulsatile blood flow model that is fully time-dependent. Systemic and pulmonary arteries and veins are modeled as compliance chambers, and the elements that connect these chambers operate as linear resistors, equipped with valves as needed. The systemic circulation is partitioned into upper and lower parts to allow for the effects of gravity and the acceleration forces of launch and landing. We consider the case of partial collapse of the systemic veins as they enter the thorax, allowing for changes in intrathoracic pressure from anti-G-straining maneuvers (AGSM). Both models include a feedback controller that monitors upper systemic arterial pressure as well as stroke volume and adjusts heart rate and systemic venous reserve volume to keep the monitored variables constant. The model was calibrated using biometric data from human centrifuge simulations of various spaceflight scenarios.

    <EventDescription>Despite the many benefits of hormonal contraceptives composed of exogenous estrogen and/or progesterone, some go beyond contraception, adverse side effects with high doses such as thrombosis and myocardial infarction, cause hesitation to usage. This work considers a menstrual cycle model that can predict the mean daily levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones throughout a normal menstrual cycle. Our modeling framework utilizes optimal control theory to determine minimum total exogenous hormone dose, and timing of administration that lead to contraception. Simulation results show a reduction in dosage of about 92\% in estrogen monotherapy and 43\% in progesterone monotherapy. In addition, combination therapy significantly lower doses further. These results may give clinicians insights into optimal dosing scheme for contraception.

    <EventDescription>One of the preeminent goals of modern mathematical biology is to reveal the molecular mechanism of human diseases and develop effective drugs with side-effect-free to cope with newly emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Developing mathematical-based models and algorithms to reliably and efficiently predict the molecular property and structure is the most crucial task to achieve that goal. Consequently, many mathematical theories, such as graph theory, differential geometry, algebraic topology, and name to few, have been thoroughly studied and integrated into the prediction models for protein-drug binding sites, protein-drug binding affinities, and RNA secondary structures.

This minisymposium addresses the recent advances in mathematical biology to understand biology at the molecular level via its structure and property. It provides an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas and initialize the collaboration between the experts from disciplinary fields.</EventDescription>

Consequently, many mathematical theories, such as graph theory, differential geometry, algebraic topology, and name to few, have been thoroughly studied and integrated into the prediction models for protein-drug binding sites, protein-drug binding affinities, and RNA secondary structures.

This minisymposium addresses the recent advances in mathematical biology to understand biology at the molecular level via its structure and property. It provides an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas and initialize the collaboration between the experts from disciplinary fields.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>There are many flavors of mathematical and computational analysis motivated by neuroscience.  In this minisymposium, we survey some recent works that hew especially closely to experimental data.  These works start from experimental data, confront the biological complexity that underlies the data, and refer back to data for confirmation of validity.  The talks will include the presentation of novel mathematical and computational methods that allow the speakers to extract order and principles out of messy, complex empirical origins.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Inflammation is a complex biological phenomenon that can manifest in a variety of ways: tissue damage, infection, or steady-state regulation. Inflammation can either be protective or pathological due to the context, system, subsystem, or processes that are inducing the response. Cellular and molecular mediators of inflammation are involved in a range of physiological and biological processes including, tissue remodeling, metabolism, and behavioral responses. Understanding the breadth of inflammatory responses that may occur and the variety of ways in which it may manifest requires careful consideration of the mediators and pathways that arise during inflammation and the bodies immunological response. Crafting robust models that include how the process interacts with patient-specific physiology has generated new insights into inflammation. In this symposium we will investigate the different ways in which inflammation may manifest, with an emphasis on immune system response due to perturbations via different mechanisms: burn, infection, or tissue injury. Speakers will share different ways to model inflammation due to these injury mechanisms and how these models can be used to consider outcomes in a patient or an organ system.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The vast majority of cellular functions depend critically on the dynamics of intracellular components, ranging from ions and small metabolites to proteins and micron-scale organelles. Participants in this minisymposium will investigate the dynamics of various intracellular environment across scales. The mathematical models used to investigate these processes involve deterministic PDEs, stochastic particle-based approaches, and agent-based simulations which will be studied by novel numerical methods, parameter-fitting using image data, and analytical approaches. In several cases, these modeling studies will be closely coupled to single-molecule imaging assays, which are commonly used to calibrate model parameters and improve model accuracy. In particular, topics include:
1. Influence of the endothelial surface layer on the motion of red blood cells.
2. Maturation of centrosomes in the early C. elegans embryo.
3. Microtubule dynamics and polarity in dendrites of neurons.
4. Effect of heterogenous Endoplasmic Reticulum network morphology on diffusive spreading of membrane proteins at Endoplasmic Reticulum exit sites.
5. Optimal curvature of airinemes in zebrafish in long-range cell-cell communication.
6. Effective pairwise interactions in collective motion models of chromosomes moving around during mitosis.
7. Small time-scale reaction-diffusion catalytic processes.
8. Motor-driven intracellular transport along cytoskeletal networks.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>An outstanding challenge in the clinical care of cancer is moving from a one-size-fits-all approach that relies on population-level statistics towards personalized therapeutic design. Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool in treatment personalization, as it allows for the incorporation of patient-specific data so that treatment can be tailor-designed to the individual. In this talk, we present a mathematical model of murine cancer immunotherapy that has been previously-validated against the average of an experimental dataset. We then ask: what happens if we try to use this same model to perform personalized fits, and therefore make individualized treatment recommendations? We find that if we approach this task by choosing a single cost function and a single fitting methodology, the personalized predictions made by the model may be of limited value. Using our modeling framework, we are able to identify what additional data would be needed, and/or what experimental conditions need to be met, in order to improve confidence in personalized model predictions.

    <EventDescription>Whisking is the rhythmic cyclic vibrissae sweeping action, consisting of repetitive forward (protraction) and backward (retraction) movements at an average frequency of about 8 Hz. At the basis of whisking generation is the vIRt nucleus in the medulla, composed of inhibitory neurons which innervate motoneurons of the vibrissa muscles [Adibi, Front Syst Neurosci (2019)].
Starting from the microscopic dynamics of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, we construct and analyse an exact neural mass model of the vIRt circuit composed of two inhibitory coupled neuronal populations with adaptation and exponentially decaying synapses, with the purpose of finding a model able to explain the generation of a rhythm driving the whisking activity in rodents. 
In this work, we show the role played by the adaptation in guiding the emergent dynamics. Various dynamical regimes can be observed: periodic collective oscillations (in phase and in antiphase), asymmetric collective oscillations, asymmetric fixed points and various bistability regions in the parameter space. In addition to that, it is found that adaptation is a mechanism by which Cross-Frequency Coupling between theta and gamma frequencies can occur. We also introduce the effects of the pre-Bötzinger complex through an external inhibitory oscillating forcing and we study the phase locking between the two populations, in order to evaluate the forcing influence on both populations.

    <EventDescription>A major developmental milestone during early childhood is the consolidation of sleep from a biphasic sleep-wake pattern (afternoon nap and nighttime sleep episodes) to a single monophasic nighttime sleep episode. An advance in the timing of the circadian system is associated with reduced napping behavior, but it is unknown if this advance is a feature of the developing circadian system or altered patterns of light exposure. Using a validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker, we investigated potential mechanisms for producing the circadian phases associated with napping and non-napping light schedules. Extant physiological and behavioral data from 20 children (34.2±2.0 months) were used in this analysis. We found that the model predicted different circadian phases for each pattern of light exposure: both the decrease in afternoon light during the nap and the later bedtimes associated with napping toddlers contributed to the observed differences in circadian phase. In addition, we systematically quantified the effects on phase shifting due to nap duration, timing, and light intensity. We found larger phase delays occurred for longer and earlier naps. Therefore, napping status affects circadian timing due to altered patterns of light exposure. Furthermore, these findings suggest napping status may affect re-entrainment dynamics in toddlers experiencing circadian misalignment (e.g., jet lag). </EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>There is an increasing potential to incorporate recent advances in our understanding of molecular-genetic pathways of flowering-time regulation to forecast shifts in flowering phenology in response to rising temperature. Recent studies developed models that integrate temperature and photoperiod signals into the network of floral regulatory genes, and predicted the shortening of flowering duration under warming based on the expression dynamics of major flowering-time genes in the perennial herb Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera. Nevertheless, empirical testing of the model prediction is still lacking. We performed temperature manipulation experiments and common garden experiments to test the model predictions using plants from two distant populations of A. halleri. We also quantified expression levels of two major flowering-time genes and compared the observed and predicted gene expression patterns. Our experiments in the laboratory and the field demonstrated that flowering duration of A. halleri was significantly shortened under warming conditions. Our results also revealed that the end of flowering was more sensitive to the climate warming than the onset of flowering in A. halleri. The approach that integrates phenology monitoring, gene expression analyses, and mathematical modeling that we employed in this study will be a powerful tool to predict how ecosystem respond to future climate change.

    <EventDescription>Blood flow through vessels results in shear stress exerted on the vessel walls, and this wall shear stress (WSS) is responsible for many important physiological processes. In the microcirculation WSS has been linked to regulating endothelial cell behavior driving both the creation of new vessels (angiogenesis) as well as changes to microvascular network topology (angioadaptation). Despite its importance, spatial characteristics of the WSS in realistic 3D microvascular networks arising due to both the presence of highly deformable red blood cells (RBCs) as well as the geometric complexity of the vasculature remain largely unknown. In the first part of this talk, I will discuss recent findings (Balogh \&amp; Bagchi 2019) using a high-fidelity, 3D computational model of blood flow in microvascular networks with RBCs fully resolved. Characteristics of the full 3D distribution of WSS and its gradient (WSSG) will be discussed as arising due to bifurcations, mergers, and vessel tortuosity. Furthermore, the specific influence of RBCs on such characteristics will be presented. In the second part of this talk I will discuss more recent work on WSS specifically in angiogenic microvascular networks which integrates in vivo data with both 1D and fully resolved 3D models. Findings and new insights into the actual WSS values observed in such networks, as well as the heterogeneity and spatial characteristics, will be presented.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Particulate flows are ubiquitous in various applications such as biological flows. Here we study mixing in vesicle suspensions. Vesicles, which resist bending and are locally inextensible, serve as an experimental and numerical proxy for red blood cells. The motivating application is the study of transport phenomena in microcirculation. We investigate transport specifically in a Couette apparatus, which is governed by an advection-diffusion equation, and we consider mixing in the absence and presence of vesicles using our boundary integral equation simulations in two dimensions. 

The advection-diffusion equation is discretized spectrally in space, and with a second-order L-stable Strang splitting in time. The mass transport equation is coupled with the vesicle suspension through the velocity field and the initial condition. 

To our knowledge, there are no universally accepted measures of mixing. Here, we study two measures: the mix-norm defined by a Sobolev norm of negative index and a standard moment fluctuation of the transported species. We define mixing efficiency in terms of mixing measure in the absence of vesicles relative to the measure in the presence of vesicles. We then study the correlation of mixing efficiency with the Peclet number, the volume fraction of the vesicle suspension, and the type of initial conditions.

    <EventDescription>Astrocytes, a type of glial brain cell, are known to play an active role in almost all areas of embryonic development and homeostasis of the central nervous system. Experimental studies have shown that, postnatally, astrocytes behave similarly to epithelial cells: they establish individual spatial domains with limited overlap with their neighbors and they mechanically interact with their neighbors by adhering via their processes and repelling their cell bodies. To examine the distribution of forces in migrating astrocytes in a wound healing assay, we develop a vertex model that restricts traction force generation to the leading front and compare numerical simulations to experimental data.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Sorting cells based on their intrinsic properties is a highly desirable objective, since changes in cell deformability are often associated with various stress conditions and diseases. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) devices offer high precision for rigid spherical particles, while their success in sorting deformable particles remains limited due to the complexity of cell traversal in DLD devices. We employ mesoscopic hydrodynamics simulations to better understand flow properties of red blood cells (RBCs) traversing through different DLD devices. In particular, we demonstrate prominent advantages of sharp-edged obstacles for probing deformability properties of RBCs. Furthermore, we will illustrate how single cell dynamics governs its motion through DLD devices, which can serve as a possible sorting strategy. Interestingly, good sensitivity to changes in intrinsic properties of RBCs requires fine-tuning of flow conditions, including flow strength and device geometry. We expect that similar mechanisms should be applicable for the development of novel DLD devices that target intrinsic properties of many other cells.

    <EventDescription>Synaptic plasticity is considered the primary mechanism for learning and memory. Neurons with similar activity patterns strengthen their synaptic connections, while others connections may weaken. Synaptic plasticity is rarely examined at the mesoscopic level, as, typically, comparisons between spike times or firing rates of individual neurons are required to update the synaptic coupling strength. Assuming a network of coupled Kuramoto oscillators, we define spike time differences in terms of phase differences. We then update the coupling weights based on these phase differences. By approximating the coupling weight dynamics with the average coupling strength and applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we arrive at a mean-field description of the network dynamics. This mean-field model allows us to examine the role of synaptic plasticity at the mesoscopic level and investigate the formation of cluster states in a tractable manner.

    <EventDescription>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease associated with an elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Sustained vasoconstriction is one of the hallmarks of PAH. Thus, the treatments of PAH include arterial vasodilators (such as PDE5 inhibitors) along with the inhalation of nitrous oxide (NO). To understand the mechanics and degree of effectiveness of these pharmacological treatments, it is necessary to quantitatively estimate the impact of various chemical pathways on the modulation of the active tone of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). To do so, we aim to develop a biochemo-mechanical model that couples the NO-sGC-cGMP chemical pathway with a hemodynamics model.

    <EventDescription>Disruptions to the electrical behavior of the heart caused by cardiac arrhythmias can result in complex dynamics, including highly irregular or chaotic action potentials. Accurate forecasts of cardiac voltage behavior could allow new opportunities for intervention and control but would require efficient computational methods. In this talk we discuss our recent work using machine-learning approaches based in reservoir computing to forecast cardiac action potentials. We show that such methods can successfully and efficiently predict time series of synthetic and experimental datasets of cardiac voltage for multiple action potentials.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Throughout our daily lives, we establish connections with other individuals either by visiting a grocery store, attending a local social gathering, or meeting with family and friends.  We can view these interactions as a person’s general social network.  Certain events such as a large-scale natural disaster can disrupt these networks by either reducing the number of connections or disconnecting certain connections.  As observed in the recent pandemic, the localities that enacted strong health measures with regard to minimizing social interactions helped reduce the transmission of the disease.  In this presentation, we will examine how changes in the network structure can impact the spread of an infectious disease.   	</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>We present a simple framework for calculating the electric potential by solving the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation and the free solvation energies of large biomolecules. We develop a novel solver capable of solving nonlinear elliptic equations, where the diffusion coefficient, the source term, the solution and its flux are discontinuous across the interface. We also develop a fast algorithm to construct the surfaces of large molecules. The interface is represented by the zero-level set of a signed distance function, empowering a natural and systematic approach to generate adaptive Cartesian grids, which drastically reduce the computational cost by focusing resources to regions near the surface of the molecules. The solver is implemented on a forest of Octree grids in parallel to enable fast computations over large molecules.

    <EventDescription>Glaucoma is a severe neuropathology of the eye representing the second major cause of blindness worldwide. Elevated value of intraocular pressure (IOP) is the established risk factor and is determined by the balance between production and drainage of aqueous humor (AH), a watery transparent fluid including electrolytes and low protein concentration. Reducing AH production (AHP) is one approach to reduce IOP.  Herein we develop a mathematical model of AHP based on a lumped version of the 3D Velocity-Extended Poisson-Nernst-Planck differential system in stationary conditions. Model variables represent the compartment values of electric potential, ion molar densities and AH fluid pressure and are numerically determined by a fixed-point iteration designed to prevent spurious oscillations and negative ion concentrations. The proposed formulation is employed as a virtual laboratory to investigate the quantitative impact of Na+/K+ pump on AHP.  Model predictions indicate that AHP reduction is maximal for intermediate levels of pump activity whereas a larger inhibition of ATPase activity does not significantly reduce AHP. These results demonstrate a non-linear relationship of ATPase to AHP and demonstrate how mathematical virtual laboratories may assist in best practices for design of IOP lowering medications.

    <EventDescription>Most integrated models of the Covid pandemic have been developed under the assumption that the policy-sensitive reproduction number is certain. The decision to exit from the lockdown has been made in most countries without knowing the reproduction number that would prevail after the deconfinement. In this paper, we explore the role of uncertainty and learning on the optimal dynamic lockdown policy. We limit the analysis to suppression strategies. In the absence of uncertainty, the optimal confinement policy is to impose a constant rate of lockdown until the suppression of the virus in the population. We show that introducing uncertainty about the reproduction number of deconfined people reduces the optimal initial rate of confinement.

    <EventDescription>The origin of chromosomes was a major transition in the evolution of complex cellular life. In this talk, we model the origin of chromosomes by considering a simple protocell composed of two types of genes: a ``fast gene' with an advantage for gene-level self-replication and a ``slow gene' that replicates more slowly at the gene level, but which confers an advantage for protocell-level reproduction. Using a PDE to describe the effects of within-cell and between-cell competition, we find that the gene-level advantage of fast replicators casts a long shadow on the multilevel dynamics of protocell evolution: no level of between-protocell competition can produce coexistence of the fast and slow replicators when the two genes are equally needed for protocell-level reproduction. We find that introducing a ``dimer replicator', a linked pair of the slow and fast genes, can allow for long-time coexistence under multilevel competition between fast, slow, and dimer replicators. Our results suggest that the formation of a simple chromosome-like dimer replicator can help to overcome the shadow of lower-level selection and work in concert with multilevel selection to promote coexistence of genes that compete under gene-level replication but are synergistic at a higher level of selection.

    <EventDescription>Suppression gene drives (SGDs) spread a deleterious genetic cargo through a population by biasing their own inheritance. This technology offers a promising solution to the burden posed by crop pests and vectors of important human diseases. Presently, theoretical and experimental studies favor SGD constructs that quickly eradicate a population. If drive killing occurs faster than drive spreading, however, the target species can be locally eradicated. In the presence of migration from a non-controlled region, local eradication risks the re-invasion of wild-type immigrants, consequently undermining or even reversing suppression efforts. How might we balance drive lethality with target population permanence in the presence of bidirectional migration? In this work, we seek to answer this question for select SGDs. We use an agent-based model to account for heterogeneity in population density across a lattice landscape. Bidirectional migration is considered between a target and a non-target population. SGD performance is studied as migration levels vary, and we seek to establish under what conditions the drive persists in a suppressed target population while remaining robust to migration.

    <EventDescription>This is a study of the dynamical effects of the application of electromagnetic flux on discrete Chialvo neuron (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03219). I will talk about how the model manifests rich dynamical behaviors like multistability, firing patterns, antimonotonicity, closed invariant curves, various routes to chaos, and fingered chaotic attractors. I will next talk about how we have adopted the traditional techniques of bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent diagram, phase portraits, basins of attraction, and numerical continuation of bifurcations to confirm the dynamical behaviors exhibited by the system. Finally, I will shift my discussion from a single neuron to a network of Chialvo neurons and will end the talk by exploring how different dynamical regimes such as synchronous, asynchronous, and chimera states are revealed.

    <EventDescription>We describe a novel toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic (TK/TD) model of the probability of mortality due to the inhalation of the nerve agent sarin (GB) in rats. The model describes uptake, clearance, and the dynamics of GB and acetylcholinesterase with a set of 4 coupled ordinary differential equations. The model parameters were determined by using recent data on lethal dosage values for rats and mice obtained using modern techniques. This simple model accurately reproduces results from historical data sets and can predict the probability of mortality for GB for exposures with arbitrary concentration/time histories. The model was run using concentration/time history data from Large Eddy Simulation to provide a realistic exposure scenario with high levels of intermittency. The results of the TK/TD model were compared with a calculation done using a Lagrangian transport code and a toxic load model under identical atmospheric conditions. The results from the two models differ significantly at both long and short exposure times, and we explain this difference in terms of the limitations of the toxic load model in these cases. This TK/TD model represents a first step in providing human injury and fatality calculation tools for the next generation of hazard prediction codes. A physiologically based TK/TD model is a well-founded alternative for predicting effects over the large range of exposure times and concentration histories likely in realistic exposure scenarios.

    <EventDescription>Patients with illnesses or infections that affect the respiratory system are commonly treated with mechanical ventilation (MV) in severe cases. While MV is often a life-saving intervention, it can induce further lung damage called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Experimental data has indicated an increased risk for VILI in elderly patients. This information along with the increased demand for MV caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the need for further research on the age-dependent aspects of VILI. This paper expands upon a previous ordinary differential equation model for MV (Minucci $\textit{et al}$., JTB 2021) by including more biologically realistic dynamics for cell and cytokine diffusion into the alveolar lung space following epithelial damage. Additionally, we utilize $\textit{in vivo}$ mouse data to create plausible parameter estimates associated with both the young and old mice experiments. Parameter sets are then analyzed using various statistical methods, including random forest and other classification methods, to determine the important factors associated with severe or moderate responses to MV for both the young and old experimental groups. We also identify representative parameter sets that best depict the average transient behavior for each response group. Using the representative sets we identify significant parameters and simulate potential interventions to improve the response to MV.

    <EventDescription>The widespread usage of the "continuous (or flash) glucose monitoring
(FGM)" is an exciting development in the field of glucose monitoring
technology. The glucose time series, collected every 15 minutes for
two weeks, represents a high resolution, high density source of
information that can potentially be mined to characterize the
physiology of a patient's glucose disposal in some detail. A consensus
analysis recently developed by the ATTD (Danne et al., Diabetes Care,
2017) aims to standardize the metrics used to characterize an FGM; most
of these, however, are morphological in nature. We argue that
"classical" investigations, such as the OGTT, which aim to quantify
glucose clearance ought to be possible to translate to the FGM. I will
describe our attempts to develop (i) a proof-of-concept version of the
OGTT for the FGM, and (ii) models of A1C determined from the FGM trace.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>
The surgery using the decellularized human umbilical artery (UA) as a by-pass graft is employed to repair the occluded or narrowed coronary artery to restore normal blood flow. During the decellularization process, immunogenic cellular components in the UA are removed to minimize the immune cells’ biological activities on the extracellular matrix for the UA’s adaptation to the patient’s coronary artery. To make the decellularization process more complete, the outer layer is removed, and only the inner layer is used for the bypass graft. The stiffness of the layer-reduced UA is different from the original UA, and is difficult to measure directly by lab experiments due to its tiny, cylindrical shape. This study aims at establishing proper biomechanical models and employing numerical techniques to obtain the stiffness of the layer-reduced UA. A strain-energy function for the isotropic elastic material and fibers in the tissue is set up to derive the Cauchy stress with prescribed internal pressure boundary conditions. The models consist of stiffness parameters for the shear modulus and fiber stiffness. Experimental data and theoretical results are used to set up the objective functions. We employ optimization techniques by MATLAB to obtain the stiffness parameters. The results are analyzed for its significant physiological effects used in the by-pass graft.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Group selection models combine selection pressure at the individual level with selection pressure at the group level. Cooperation can be costly for individuals, but beneficial for the group, and therefore, if individuals are sufficiently much assorted, and cooperators find themselves in groups with disproportionately many other cooperators, cooperation can evolve. The existing literature on group selection generally assumes that competition between groups takes place in a well-mixed population of groups, where any group competes with any other group equally intensely. Competition between groups however might very well occur locally; groups may compete more intensely with nearby than with far-away groups. We show that if competition between groups is indeed local, then the evolution of cooperation can be hindered significantly by the fact that groups with many cooperators will
mostly compete against neighboring groups that are also highly cooperative, and therefore harder to outcompete. The existing empirical method for determining how conducive a group structured population is to the evolution of cooperation also implicitly assumes global between-group competition, and therefore gives (possibly very) biased estimates.

    <EventDescription>Since the introduction of electronic cigarettes to the United States market in 2007, vaping prevalence has surged in both adult and adolescent populations. E-cigarettes are advertised as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes and as a method of smoking cessation, but the U.S. government and health professionals are concerned that e-cigarettes attract young non-smokers. Here, we develop and analyze a dynamical systems model of competition between traditional and electronic cigarettes for users. With this model, we predict the change in smoking prevalence due to the introduction of vaping, and we determine the conditions under which e-cigarettes present a net public health benefit or harm to society.

    <EventDescription>The formation of wall-adherent platelet aggregates is a critical process in arterial thrombosis. A growing aggregate experiences frictional drag forces exerted on it by fluid moving over or through the aggregate. The magnitudes of these forces are strongly influenced by the permeability of the developing aggregate; the permeability depends on the aggregate’s porosity. Aggregation is mediated by formation of ensembles of molecular bonds; each bond involves a plasma protein bridging the gap between specific receptors on the surfaces of two different platelets. The ability of the bonds existing at any time to sustain the drag forces on the aggregate determines whether it remains intact or sheds individual platelets or larger fragments (emboli). Our computational model tracks the formation and breaking of bonds between platelets and treats the thrombus as an evolving porous, viscoelastic material, which moves differently from the background fluid. This relative motion generates drag
forces which the fluid and thrombus exert on one another. These forces are computed from a permeability-porosity relation parameterized from our group’s experimental measurements. Basing this relation on measurements from occlusive thrombi formed in our flow chamber experiments, along with other physiological parameter values, the model produces stable dense thrombi on a similar timescale to the experiments.

    <EventDescription>The presence of impermeant molecules within a cell establishes a Donnan effect that, if left unchecked, will increase the cell volume due to the osmotic flux of water until it lyses. The Donnan effect can be counteracted by actively pumping Na+ out of the cell. This effectively stabilizes the cell by equalizing the osmolarity across the membrane but demands the continuous expenditure of energy to preserve this dynamic steady-state. In this talk, we introduce a system of five algebraic and differential equations, the so-called pump-leak model, that describes a cell's ion and water fluxes and membrane potential. First, we show that the model admits a stable steady state in the presence of a sodium pump, which constantly pumps Na+ out- and Cl- inside the cell. Then, using the model, we show that extracellular impermeant molecules can stabilize a cell in the absence of sodium pumps. We show how a cell may use both mechanisms to control its volume with less energy. Besides sodium pumps and extracellular impermeant molecules, we incorporate into our model a family of the Solute Carrier transporter superfamily called Cation-Coupled Cotransporters (CCCs), which transport Na+ and/or K+ and Cl– across the cell membrane. We will show how CCCs can assist cells in regulating ion levels and cell volume.

    <EventDescription>In this talk, I will first briefly review existing classifications of bursting patterns. Then I will generalise a recent example that falls outside of these classification systems and present an extended classification, which requires the analysis of both fast and slow subsystems of an underlying slow-fast model and allows the dissection of a larger class of bursters. This new class of bursters with at least two slow variables will be denoted \textit{folded-node bursters}, to convey the idea that the bursts are initiated or annihilated via a \textit{folded-node singularity}. Key to this mechanism are so-called \textit{canard} or \textit{duck} orbits, organizing the underpinning excitability structure. I will describe the two main families of folded-node bursters, depending upon the phase (active/spiking or silent/non-spiking) of the bursting cycle during which folded-node dynamics occurs. I will classify both families and give examples of minimal systems displaying these novel bursting patterns. Finally, I will provide a biophysical example by reinterpreting a generic conductance-based episodic burster as a folded-node burster, showing that the associated framework can explain its subthreshold oscillations over a larger parameter region than the fast-subsystem approach.

    <EventDescription>Certain defense mechanisms of phages against the
immune system of their bacterial host
rely on cooperation of phages. Motivated by this example we analyse
invasion probabilities of cooperative parasites in host populations that
are moderately structured. More precisely
we assume that hosts are arranged on the vertices of a configuration
model and that offspring of parasites move to nearest neighbours sites
to infect new hosts. We consider parasites that generate many offspring
at reproduction, but do this (usually) only when infecting a host
simultaneously. In this regime we identify and analyse the spatial scale
of the population structure at which invasion of parasites turns from
being an unlikely to an highly probable event.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The tragedy of the commons occurs when cheaters invade a population of cooperators who contribute to the common good of the population. Cheaters reap the benefits of cooperation but they do not incur the cost. This creates a growth benefit for the cheaters. In the long run they dominate the mixed population leading to a shortage of the common good and ultimately to the demise of both cooperators and cheaters alike. We report on experimental work that confirms the tragedy of the commons in bacterial populations in the chemostat. We also discuss a variety of mechanisms to avoid the tragedy and report on the analysis of the corresponding mathematical models.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Foraging is a ubiquitous behavior performed by all animals as search for food is crucial for survival. When the animal is foraging throughout its environment searching for resources, it is employing a variety of cognitive computations from decision making to planning to learning in addition to adjusting its bodily dynamics. Foraging as a behavior allows studying cognitive dynamics in a natural context and opens up the opportunity for evolutionary comparison across species. In my presentation, I will provide a conceptual framework for an integrative understanding of patch foraging focusing on recently developed bayesian mechanistic models, that delineate the potential decision strategies an animal might employ to decide when and how to leave a patch of food across environments with different statistics. I will discuss how these models can be extended to the social foraging realm. I will also contextualize the theoretical models in relation to field data from a variety of species and their potential to design large scale naturalistic experiments in traditional laboratory animal models.

    <EventDescription>Since the pioneering works of Hodgkin and Huxley (HH), cell electrophysiology has been modeled via ordinary differential equations. In this talk, we will show how the classic HH model can be replaced by a single delay differential equation (DDE). In addition, we present some benefits (e.g., for modeling Alternans) and challenges (e.g., new numerical methods) associated with the use of DDEs in cardiac modeling.

    <EventDescription>A classic approach for modeling the spread of the sexually transmitted diseases is to assume a zero inherent length infection contact. However, in the population with long-term partnerships, the infection status of the partners, the length of the partnership, and the exclusivity of the partnership, all affect the rate of infection. Additionally, the presence of the pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) also impacts the dynamics of the disease. Our goal  is to develop a compartmental model that accounts for various partnership scenarios as well as the uptake and adherence to the PrEP treatment. Reproduction numbers are calculated and global stability of both disease-free and endemic equilibria will be shown with appropriate conditions. Sensitivity and PRCC analysis are performed on the key parameters to determine the degree to which each affects the disease transmission dynamics. The results suggest that increasing the adherence among the current PrEP users is a more effective (and likely more cost-efficient) strategy in the fight against the HIV epidemic than increased coverage with poor adherence. However, when both casual and long-term partnerships are accounted for in the population, even with the maximum level of compliance and full PrEP coverage, stopping the spread of HIV will require additional interventions.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Geometric algebra is a powerful framework that unifies mathematics and physics. Since its revival in the middle of the 1960s by David Hestenes, it attracts great attention and has been exploited in many fields such as physics, computer science, and engineering. This work introduces a geometric algebra method for the molecular surface generation that utilizes the Clifford-Fourier transform which is a generalization of the classical Fourier transform. Notably, the classical Fourier transform and Clifford-Fourier transform differ in the derivative property in $\mathbb{R}_k$ for $k$ even. This distinction is due to the noncommutativity of geometric product of pseudoscalars with multivectors and has significant consequences in applications. We use the Clifford-Fourier transform in $\mathbb{R}_3$ to benefit from the derivative property in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The Clifford-Fourier transform is used to solve the mode decomposition process in PDE transform. Two different initial cases are proposed to make the initial shapes used in the present method. The proposed method is applied first to small molecules and proteins.   To validate the method, the molecular surfaces generated are compared to surfaces of other definitions. Applications are considered to protein electrostatic analysis. 
This work opens the door for further applications of geometric algebra and Clifford-Fourier transform in biological sciences.

    <EventDescription>The spread of an infectious disease depends on intrinsic properties of the disease as well as the connectivity and actions of the population. This study investigates the dynamics of an SIR type model which accounts for human tendency to avoid infection while also maintaining preexisting, interpersonal relationships. Specifically, we use a network model in which individuals probabilistically  deactivate connections to infected individuals and later reconnect to  the same individuals upon recovery. To analyze this network model, a mean field approximation consisting of a system of fourteen ordinary differential equations for the number of nodes and edges is developed. This system of equations is closed using a moment closure approximation for the number of triple links. By analyzing the differential equations, it is shown that, in addition to force of infection and recovery rate, the probability of deactivating edges and the average node degree of the underlying network determine if an epidemic occurs.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In classic MacArthur models, the number of consumers and resources is fixed from the onset. However, nature itself is never this static, and in real-life experiments, consumers (e.g. bacteria) can quickly acquire adaptations to increase their consumption. In this project, we set certain parameters of the model free by adding new species that are a small perturbation of their ancestors, mimicking evolution. In such an approach, individual species become less interesting and we need to study the long time average dynamics to understand how the modelled ecosystem behaves. The goal is to find interesting, or the 'right', measures to quantify the average dynamics, allowing us to draw conclusions on the structure of the ecosystem and make comparisons with experiments possible.

    <EventDescription>A combination of oncolytic viral therapy and immunotherapy provides an alternative option to the standard of care for treating the lethal brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). Although this combination therapy shows promise, there are many unknown questions regarding how the tumor landscape and spatial dosing strategies impact the effectiveness of the treatment. We aim to shed light on these questions using a novel spatially explicit computational model of GBM response to treatment. Our results suggest that oncolytic viral dosing in the location of highest tumor cell density leads to substantial tumor size reduction over viral dosing in the center of the tumor. These results can help to inform future clinical trials and more effective treatment strategies for oncolytic viral therapy in GBM patients.

    <EventDescription>Circadian rhythms are fundamental to all aspects of physiology and behavior, ranging from cellular dynamics to work performance. Measuring circadian phase has mostly been achieved in carefully controlled laboratory conditions. The development and ubiquitous presence of smartphones and wearable devices have made it possible to passively detect and collect information of user behavior and health. Here, we discuss different methods developed to measure circadian phase from wearable devices in the real life settings. First, we present mathematical models of the human circadian clock, with different types of data collected from both research-grade and consumer-grade wearable devices. We then discuss using activity, which is recorded in almost every wearable device, to predict circadian phase in the real life settings. Finally, we present an application and extension of models of the circadian clock. Coupled with optimal control theory, these models can be used to provide optimal schedules to adjust the human circadian clock in daily life.

    <EventDescription>Impairments in retinal blood flow and oxygenation have been implicated as contributing to the progression of glaucoma. Here, an established theoretical hybrid model of a retinal microvascular network is extended to include the effects on oxygenation of local blood flow regulation.  A heterogeneous representation of the arterioles based on confocal microscopy images is combined with a compartmental description of the capillaries and venules downstream.  A Green's function method is used to simulate oxygen transport in the arterioles, and a Krogh cylinder model is used in the capillary and venule compartments.  Acute blood flow regulation is simulated in response to changes in pressure, shear stress, and metabolism.  
When blood flow regulation mechanisms are inhibited, model results predict a decrease in tissue oxygenation, as well as a greater spread in tissue oxygen levels throughout the vascular network.  These results demonstrate that the oxygenation of the retina can be negatively impacted by impairments in blood flow regulation. The results also highlight the importance of using a spatially heterogeneous vascular network representation, as localized regions of poor oxygenation can be predicted that would not be identified using averaged oxygen measurements.  This model framework will allow for comparisons to sectorial-specific clinical data, to help assess the potential role of impaired blood flow regulation in glaucoma.

    <EventDescription>We present a fully Eulerian numerical method to simulate the interactions of deformable solids in fluids. With the reference map technique (RMT), we model finite-strain solids undergoing large deformation on one fixed grid. Fluids are coupled to the same grid and simulated using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. Our hybrid approach (LBRMT) provides a new implementation to model moving deformable boundary conditions in the LB method, and a simple and unified coupling of solids and fluids. It also inherits the improved computational performance from the LB method to simulate quasi-incompressible fluids in a parallelized fashion. The LBRMT is apt at simulating multi-body contact of complex geometries since it uses one global velocity field for both phases. We demonstrate the convergence and applicability of the LBRMT in fluid–structure interaction (FSI) through examples of lid-driven cavity with deformable solids, sedimentation and floatation of soft bodies, bending and twisting of flexible rotors, and collective motion of actuated microswimmers.

    <EventDescription>
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of drugs initially approved to treat type 2 diabetes that have subsequently been approved for the prevention of cardiovascular events, renal outcomes, and heart failure.  SGLT2 is the main transporter involved in renal glucose reabsorption whereas SGLT1 plays a primary role in intestinal glucose absorption and a lesser role in renal glucose reabsorption.  Inhibiting SGLT2 reduces renal glucose reabsorption, increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE), which in turn reduces plasma glucose concentrations and provides negative energy balance.  

Mathematical modeling was applied throughout the discovery and development programs to help characterize many of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors (and combined SGLT1/2 inhibitors), including effects on renal glucose reabsorption, plasma glucose and HbA1c levels, intestinal glucose absorption, beta-cell function, fluid balance and hemodynamics, and body weight regulation.  This talk will focus on two of these topics: (1) characterizing the rate of UGE as a function of both plasma glucose and drug concentrations and the development and application of a practical model-based method for estimating the renal threshold for glucose excretion (2) characterizing the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on body weight regulation and subsequent insights into how food intake changes in response to weight loss.

    <EventDescription>Compartmental models of disease are typically formulated as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations in which R0 plays a key role in analysis. In this minisymposium, we will examine four different cases where important biological considerations necessitate an approach that falls outside of this mold. In one vector-host epidemiological case, acquisition and loss of immunity has important age-dependent dynamics that necessitate a nonlinear integro-differential PDE approach; motivation for this approach, well-posedness, and analysis will be discussed. In a second case, we will see how stochasticity in transmission rates for a COVID-19 model can be analyzed as a system of stochastic differential equations. Certain cases of substance use disorder (e.g alcohol and opioids) are frequently initiated by mechanisms which are not well described by an exclusively person-to-person transmission model. The approach to modeling these diseases must therefore be different, with important implications for the resulting dynamics and what mathematical tools can be used to analyze them. Finally, ecologically important diseases, such as pesticide-induced impairment on bee colonies, may require complex species- and application-specific modeling assumptions in order to properly capture the interaction between bee role dynamics and disease stressors.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Oscillations are ubiquitous in biology, occurring at all scales and performing a plethora of functions.
Genes producing regulator proteins in response to oscillatory signals can be less susceptible to stochastic fluctuations than those responding to constant inputs.
Protein oscillations help establish and maintain circadian rhythms.
Multi-strain microbial consortia exhibit population-level oscillations when integrating chemical signals and environmental cues.

Such oscillatory phenomena are often finely tuned in terms of frequency and amplitude. 
When the characteristics of a biological oscillator deviate from normal operating ranges, the results can be catastrophic: Protein over-expression, sleep disorders, hormonal problems.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying biological oscillations is therefore of great importance.
Mathematical models can both capture and suggest such mechanisms. 

This minisymposium will feature talks describing models of biological oscillations at a multitude of scales.
The benefits of such oscillations will be discussed, as will the scientific challenges that lay ahead.
These challenges span many disciplines, from medicine and physiology to biochemistry and synthetic biology.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The transport of ions through pore channel proteins in cell membranes is a fundamental process in molecular biosciences. Modeling and simulation of ion channel transport has been carried out for a long time, but there are still many important open questions, for example the gating mechanism of certain ion channels is still obscure. While x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy has succeeded in determining the 3D structure of ion channels to high accuracy, the dynamic conformation changes that occur as ions pass through a channel are almost impossible to resolve by experiment. There is great interest in utilizing mathematical modeling and computer simulations to complement experiments and address the open questions surrounding ion channel transport.  Widely-used approaches are based on the (1) Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, (2) Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system, and (3) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Among these, MD is the most physically accurate, but it is computationally expensive, and  although the PB and PNP approaches provide less physical detail, they are more efficient and can more easily incorporate the boundary and interface conditions in physical systems. In this minisymposium, the presenters will report their current research on modeling and computation of ion channel transport in cell membranes. The scope will include computational and theoretical analysis of the most commonly used models and their recent implementation.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Multiscale, mathematical models developed in combination with experiments, provide a framework for testing new mechanisms that would otherwise be experimentally intractable. Moreover, accurate and systematic parameter calibration at different biological scales is necessary for revealing the complex, non-intuitive relationships between known and unknown factors affecting the system under investigation. In this minisymposium, we bring together a diverse group of leading researchers in the field who use experimental data at different scales to develop and calibrate multiscale, mathematical and computational models. Special attention will be given to both model development and calibration techniques in order to exchange ideas and encourage further development of novel multiscale models.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Mathematical tools such as topology, differential geometry, and graph theory can be
useful in the modeling of sequence and structure-based molecular analysis, which is crucial in life
science from gene expression to cell functions. These bring the mathematical and computational
biology into a new era. Driven by gigantic biological databases, mathematics is used for sequence and
structure feature generations, molecular simulations, data analysis, et al. with advantages in efficiency
and abstractness. For example, integrated with machine learning methods, persistent homology is
constructed for revealing topological persistence and geometric shapes for biology structure analysis
in studies of protein-ligand analysis and COVID-19 related researches. However, more advanced
biology problems require the development of mathematical and computational biology to understand
the mechanism at molecule and cell levels. This minisymposium can provide a broad perspective of
advanced mathematics and its implementations in biology applications such as signal transduction,
virus infectivity, antibody-antigen interactions, and drug discovery.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Recent advances in theoretical neuroscience have strengthened the bridge from microscopic models of neural activity to population level descriptions relevant to specialised brain circuits such as the hippocampus and cortex.  This minisymposium will include a survey of the complex dynamical behaviour observed in cortico-hippocampal networks, such as waves and avalanches, and how transient behaviour can best be characterised to advance our understanding of natural computations.  The role of transitions from synchronous to asynchronous states in cortical networks of spiking neurons will be considered within the context of both health and disease, as well the topologies that lead to hybrid or chimera states (that mix synchrony and asynchrony).  The spontaneous transition between so-called up- and down-states in the hippocampus will be treated with a new rigorous reduction from microscopic neuron dynamics possessing short-term depression, shedding light on hippocampal replay for memory consolidation.  As well as the relatively fast dynamics for neural activity we shall also cover the slower evolution of protein dynamics relevant to diseases of ageing, and in particular Alzheimer's, highlighting the power of data-driven mechanistic models and modern scientific computation approaches for clinical application.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>There are many flavors of mathematical and computational analysis motivated by neuroscience.  In this minisymposium, we survey some recent works that hew especially closely to experimental data.  These works start from experimental data, confront the biological complexity that underlies the data, and refer back to data for confirmation of validity.  The talks will include the presentation of novel mathematical and computational methods that allow the speakers to extract order and principles out of messy, complex empirical origins.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The heart is one of the first organs to develop in vertebrate embryos and almost immediately begins beating. Because the heart relies on hemodynamic cues to function and develop properly, cardiac development can go awry if hemodynamic forces are altered. Cardiac contraction is coordinated by the electrophysiology of the heart, and both electrophysiological development and interaction between electrophysiology and hemodynamics in the embryonic heart remain poorly understood. Understanding how congenital heart defects arise in the heart from modulated hemodynamics or altered electrophysiology is critical to elucidating congenital heart defect therapies. However, because of the difficulties of performing experiments and acquiring data in the developing heart, models are critical for developing this understanding.

This minisymposium will present research on computational and mathematical models that have been created to elucidate mechanisms of heart development, including embryonic cardiac fluid dynamics, fluid-structure interaction, and electrophysiology. Presentations will examine heart development from a variety of perspectives throughout many stages of development, ranging from early valveless pumping behavior, mechanosensitive pathways of later development, to pacemaker development.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>In 2021, immunotherapies surpassed other therapeutic cancer interventions by having the largest number of approved drugs. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, remain a major area of immunotherapy exploration. While monotherapies show success in certain patients, for others, they fail. This may be because combination treatment is required, the drug is ill-suited for that cancer type, or it’s the wrong treatment for that specific patient. Mathematical modeling can help address these issues by improving understanding of immune interactions and maximizing clinical response through optimization of drug combinations and dosing schedules. It can also be used to predict patient-specific outcomes and determine biomarkers for treatment success.

Current trends are geared towards ensuring data-driven mathematical models are translatable to different levels of drug development from the laboratory to the hospital. Key ongoing challenges include understanding the competition between healthy and cancer cells, complementing clinical trials to determine effective therapy combinations, and the role of the spatial distribution of the tumor microenvironment. 

This minisymposium, ranging from the white board to the white coats, features immunotherapy models that include immune checkpoint inhibition in the context of cancers such as glioblastoma, melanoma, and lung cancer.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Transitions between dynamic states are ubiquitous across all scales of life, from cell differentiation during development to the desertification of the Amazon rainforest. These transitions may be regarded as emergent, transient behavior of a representative dynamical system. Traditionally, such systems have been analyzed by considering their asymptotic behavior, overlooking transient behavior. In the natural sciences, however, transient behavior has been shown to be a critical player in a wide range of systems, particularly, given that living systems are constantly changing.

This minisymposium will showcase and explore new theoretical results on dynamical transitions in nonlinear systems and their applications including, but not limited to development, neuroscience, neuroendocrinology, ecosystems, and climate. The minisymposium will be organized in two parts. The first will consider transitions in systems comprising single elements, such as individual cells or proteins. The second will investigate transitions across networks of dynamic interacting nodes, such as those observed in neuronal networks.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Mathematical modeling is a vital tool to gain valuable information on the dynamics of epidemics and the sustainability of ecosystems. Qualitative and quantitative mathematical analyses enable us to examine different situations and outcomes that are costly, difficult, and/or impossible to get experimentally. Despite significant achievements in the development of new modeling approaches to address applied needs, there are still many open issues that demand their urgent solution and justify further adjustment and study of both deterministic and stochastic models.  
The talks of this minisymposium will focus on resolving some open problems in modeling and control of nonlinear behavioral processes in epidemiology and ecological sciences, spread, and mitigation of infectious diseases. The topics will cover analytical models and numerical simulation, deterministic and stochastic contiguous models, discrete, among other tools. All talks will be of interest to mathematicians and researchers working in the related applied areas.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Across the human lifespan, sleep-wake behavior undergoes significant changes, from multiple sleeps per day during infancy and early childhood to consolidated adult sleep schedules. Throughout these transitions, the circadian rhythm sculpts the timing of sleep to entrain to the 24 h environmental light cycle. However, modern society offers many ways that humans perturb and modify their entrainment to the day-night cycle, including artificial light, melatonin supplements and shift work schedules. Mathematical modeling of sleep-wake regulation and circadian clocks are greatly contributing to understanding underlying mechanisms of sleep and circadian processes and predicting responses to environmental and external perturbations. Sleep-wake regulation models account for the interactions of wake- and sleep-promoting neural populations, under modulation by the homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm, in dictating timing and durations of sleep episodes. Classic circadian rhythm models represent circadian signaling as a limit cycle under modulation of the external light cycle, while more recent models account for the network interactions of clock cells within the suprachiasmatic nucleus generating the circadian signal. The talks in this minisymposium present analyses of sleep-wake regulation and circadian rhythm models to reveal dynamics dictating sleep behavior in different developmental stages and to understand responses to external perturbations of the circadian rhythm.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The role of the circulation is to provide efficient transport of oxygen and nutrients to every tissue of the body.  Modeling this transport can be challenging due to the multiphase nature of blood and the complex geometries through which blood flows. Nonetheless, models at multiple scales have yielded important insight into the transport of oxygen and the motion of individual red blood cells in complex vessel geometries and/or microfluidic devices.  In this minisymposium, theoretical models are presented that predict the contributions of blood flow regulation mechanisms, red blood cell distribution, and oxygen transport to blood flow dynamics.  For example, the uneven partitioning of red blood cells at vessel bifurcations can lead to heterogeneous red blood cell distributions. These factors, combined with the complex structure of vascular networks, can yield non-uniform tissue oxygenation.  This minisymposium (i) highlights models that simulate the impact of mechanics, hemodynamics, and oxygenation on cardiovascular, ocular, and neural function, and (ii) describes how red blood cell properties impact the transport of red blood cells throughout the microvasculature and in microfluidic devices.  Several of the models integrate experimental or clinical observations in applications including peripheral arterial disease, glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, aneurysms, and stroke.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>The emergence of spatiotemporal patterns has been observed throughout biology, and explored within mathematical models that often rely on underlying assumptions about symmetry. However, symmetry is rarely perfect in real life, and at least some level of disorder is largely unavoidable. Entropy can be used to characterize disorder, asymmetry and information flow in a wide range of biological settings. The goal of this two-part session will be to explore how the concepts of symmetry and entropy might provide insights into the dynamics and robustness of living systems.  The first part will focus on the juxtaposition between exact symmetries that underlie mathematical models and approximate symmetries in real systems, as well as strategies for maintaining resilience.  The second part will delve into interpretations of entropy and information flow in living systems.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Inflammation is a complex biological phenomenon that can manifest in a variety of ways: tissue damage, infection, or steady-state regulation. Inflammation can either be protective or pathological due to the context, system, subsystem, or processes that are inducing the response. Cellular and molecular mediators of inflammation are involved in a range of physiological and biological processes including, tissue remodeling, metabolism, and behavioral responses. Understanding the breadth of inflammatory responses that may occur and the variety of ways in which it may manifest requires careful consideration of the mediators and pathways that arise during inflammation and the bodies immunological response. Crafting robust models that include how the process interacts with patient-specific physiology has generated new insights into inflammation. In this symposium we will investigate the different ways in which inflammation may manifest, with an emphasis on immune system response due to perturbations via different mechanisms: burn, infection, or tissue injury. Speakers will share different ways to model inflammation due to these injury mechanisms and how these models can be used to consider outcomes in a patient or an organ system.</EventDescription>

    <EventDescription>Mathematical tools such as topology, differential geometry, and graph theory can be
useful in the modeling of sequence and structure-based molecular analysis, which is crucial in life
science from gene expression to cell functions. These bring the mathematical and computational
biology into a new era. Driven by gigantic biological databases, mathematics is used for sequence and
structure feature generations, molecular simulations, data analysis, et al. with advantages in efficiency
and abstractness. For example, integrated with machine learning methods, persistent homology is
constructed for revealing topological persistence and geometric shapes for biology structure analysis
in studies of protein-ligand analysis and COVID-19 related researches. However, more advanced
biology problems require the development of mathematical and computational biology to understand
the mechanism at molecule and cell levels. This minisymposium can provide a broad perspective of
advanced mathematics and its implementations in biology applications such as signal transduction,
virus infectivity, antibody-antigen interactions, and drug discovery.</EventDescription>
